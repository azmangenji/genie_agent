# ECO Auto-Flow — Gaps Planning & Fix Document
**Date:** 2026-04-26
**Session:** 9874 / 9868 / 9899 new runs with updated flow
**Status:** Waiting for all FM rounds to finish before applying fixes

---

## Summary

Three new ECO runs started today to validate the updated flow on both simple (9874 wire_swap) and complex (9868, 9899 multi-module DFF+gate) ECOs. Multiple gaps observed. This document records each gap for systematic fixing after all FM runs complete.

---

## GAP-1 — eco_netlist_studier: FM cell/pin path stored as wire name

**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Observed in:** 9899 Round 1 → caused ABORT_NETLIST in Round 2 FM
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_netlist_studier.md`

**What happened:**
DcqArb0_QualPhArbReqVld and DcqArb1_QualPhArbReqVld were resolved via FM fenets as `A2336162/ZN` and `A2230141/ZN`. The studier stored these FM cell/pin path notations directly as wire names in `port_connections_per_stage`. Verilog SVR-4 error: `/` is not valid in net identifiers → FM-599 ABORT_NETLIST.

**Root cause:**
The studier reads FM results in the format `i:/FMWORK.../cell_name/pin_name` and should extract just the net driven by that pin. Instead it stored the path notation verbatim.

**Fix required:**
After resolving any signal via FM equivalent nets, always look up the actual wire name by grepping the PreEco netlist:
```bash
grep -m1 "<cell_name>" <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/Synthesize.v.gz
# Read the .<output_pin>(<wire_name>) from the instance block
# Use <wire_name> — never use <cell_name>/<pin_name> notation
```
Add this as a mandatory step in eco_netlist_studier.md UNIVERSAL REAL-NET PREFERENCE RULE and PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION resolution section.

## GAP-2 — validate_verilog_netlist.py: No check for invalid net name characters

**Severity:** HIGH
**Observed in:** 9899 Round 2 — validator ran but PASSED despite `A2336162/ZN` in netlist
**File:** `script/validate_verilog_netlist.py`

**What happened:**
The validator checks F1/F2/F3/F4/F5/Check9 but has no check for invalid characters (like `/`, `\`, spaces) in net names. `A2336162/ZN` slipped through.

**Fix required:**
Add Check F6 — Net name validity:
```python
def check_invalid_net_names(mod_lines, mod_name, start_lineno):
    """F6: Detect net names containing '/' or other invalid Verilog identifiers."""
    for i, line in enumerate(mod_lines):
        for m in re.finditer(r'\.\s*\w+\s*\(\s*(\S+?)\s*\)', line):
            net = m.group(1)
            if '/' in net or '\\' in net:
                errors.append({
                    'check': 'F6_invalid_net_name',
                    'module': mod_name,
                    'msg': f"Net name '{net}' contains invalid character — FM SVR-4",
                    'line': start_lineno + i
                })
```
Always include F6 in default mode (not --strict only) — `/` in a net name is always a bug.

---

## GAP-3 — eco_pre_fm_checker: Check 8 SKIPPED in Round 1, not caught

**Severity:** HIGH
**Observed in:** 9899 Round 1 Step 5
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_pre_fm_checker.md`

**What happened:**
Round 1 Step 5 ran but the validator (Check 8) was SKIPPED. The `A2336162/ZN` invalid net name was already in the Synthesize PostEco at this point but went undetected.

**Fix required:**
The validator MUST run unless the script is genuinely unavailable. The existing mandatory self-check (added today) ensures `check8_verilog_validator` is in the JSON. Ensure the eco_pre_fm_checker agent always attempts to run the validator before marking it SKIPPED. SKIPPED should only occur if `script/validate_verilog_netlist.py` does not exist.

---

## GAP-4 — eco_pre_fm_checker: manual_only entries should not suppress Verilog error check

**Severity:** HIGH
**Observed in:** 9899 Round 2 Step 5
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_pre_fm_checker.md`

**What happened:**
In Round 2, eco_fm_analyzer classified Route c007/c008/c009 as `manual_only`. eco_pre_fm_checker saw Check A/C as "unresolvable → allow FM to run." BUT — Synthesize still had corrupt Verilog (`A2336162/ZN`) from Round 1. The manual_only classification for Route should NOT suppress the Verilog syntax check for Synthesize. FM ran with corrupt Synthesize → ABORT_NETLIST.

**Fix required:**
Add explicit rule in eco_pre_fm_checker.md:
> "Check 8 (Verilog validator) ALWAYS runs regardless of manual_only status. manual_only classification (from eco_fm_analyzer) only suppresses Check A/C escalation — it NEVER suppresses Verilog syntax validation. A FAIL in Check 8 blocks FM submission even when all Check A/C issues are classified manual_only."

---

## GAP-5 — eco_netlist_studier: A648153 (DCQARB1 A2 pin) missing from PrePlace

**Severity:** HIGH
**Observed in:** 9899 Round 3 FM — PrePlace FAIL on DCQARB1/DebugBusValDcq_reg
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_netlist_studier.md`

**What happened:**
Step 3 confirmed A648153 (DCQARB1 A2 pin, old_net=QualPmArbWinVld_d1) in Synthesize only. PrePlace showed A648363 (A1 pin) but not A648153 (A2 pin). The studier reported "No Equivalent Nets" for A648153 in PrePlace and used Stage Fallback — but did not find the correct PrePlace cell for A648153.

**Root cause:**
The PrePlace equivalent of A648153 was likely `FxPrePlace_ctmTdsLR_1_5274047` (from the old passing run analysis), but the new studier's structural trace failed to find it.

**Fix required:**
In eco_netlist_studier.md, strengthen the Stage Fallback for rewire entries:
- When a cell cannot be confirmed in PrePlace via FM, do a secondary structural trace: find the Synthesize cell's driver net → grep PrePlace netlist for cells consuming that net → find the A2 pin equivalent.
- The old passing run (20260421195535) found this cell — its step3 analysis should be referenced as a validation pattern.

## GAP-6 — eco_applier: ALREADY_APPLIED for manual_only SKIPPED entries in Route

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Observed in:** 9899 Round 3 Step 4 — eco_9899_c007/c008/c009/c_mux3/c_mux_final showed ALREADY_APPLIED in Route when they were SKIPPED since Round 1
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_applier.md`

**What happened:**
In Surgical Patch mode (Round 3), eco_applier's ALREADY_APPLIED check for eco_9899_c007 in Route returned ALREADY_APPLIED because the entry had `confirmed: true` and `force_reapply: false` (no force_reapply for Route since it was manual_only). The eco_applier treated "not in force_reapply list" as ALREADY_APPLIED without verifying the instance actually exists in the PostEco netlist.

**Fix required:**
In eco_applier.md ALREADY_APPLIED detection (Section 11), add special handling for manual_only entries:
```python
# For Surgical Patch mode: if entry is not in force_reapply list AND
# was SKIPPED in the previous round (check prior eco_applied_round<ROUND-1>.json):
prior_status = get_prior_status(entry, ROUND-1)
if prior_status == "SKIPPED":
    # Don't mark as ALREADY_APPLIED — it was never inserted
    # Mark as SKIPPED with same reason as prior round
    record(status="SKIPPED", reason=f"Carried from Round {ROUND-1}: {prior_reason}")
```

## GAP-7 — 9868 Step 1: incorrect wire declaration note

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Observed in:** 9868 Step 1 RTL diff RPT
**File:** `config/eco_agents/rtl_diff_analyzer.md`

**What happened:**
Step 1 for 9868 noted `FEI.ARB_FEI_NeedFreqAdj` port_connection in umccmd as "new wire, must add wire decl." ARB_FEI_NeedFreqAdj appears in 2 port_connections (ARB output + FEI input) → Verilog implicit wire. UNIVERSAL RULE: never add explicit `wire N;`.

**Fix required:**
In rtl_diff_analyzer.md, strengthen the implicit wire detection:
- When a signal appears in ≥2 port_connection entries in the same module → set `no_wire_decl_needed: true` and add note "implicit wire from multiple port connections — eco_applier MUST NOT add explicit wire declaration"
- The "must add wire decl" note should never appear — remove it from any existing examples or templates

---

## GAP-8 — 9868 Step 2: EcoUseSdpOutstRdCnt DFF not mentioned in RPT

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Observed in:** 9868 Step 2 RPT
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_fenets_runner.md`

**What happened:**
Step 1 identified two new DFFs: NeedFreqAdj (in ARB/CTRLSW) and EcoUseSdpOutstRdCnt (in umccmd). Step 2 only mentioned NeedFreqAdj and RegRdbRspCredits. EcoUseSdpOutstRdCnt DFF was not discussed at all in Step 2.

**Fix required:**
eco_fenets_runner.md should explicitly note when new_logic_dff entries do not require FM queries (new signals not in PreEco) — include a section:
```
No FM query needed for new DFF signals (not in PreEco reference):
  - <signal_name>: new_logic_dff — eco_netlist_studier Phase 0 handles insertion
  - <signal_name2>: new_logic_dff — same
```
This ensures eco_netlist_studier knows all DFFs to process, not just the ones appearing in FM results.

## GAP-9 — 9868 Step 2: "wire_swap" classification misleading for AND2 gate insertion

**Severity:** LOW
**Observed in:** 9868 Step 2 RPT
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_fenets_runner.md`

**What happened:**
The FEI_ARB_OutstRdDat MUX select change was described as "wire_swap in umcsdpintf" but actually requires inserting a new AND2 gate (eco_9868_c001) and then rewiring the MUX S pin to the gate output. This is NOT a simple wire swap.

**Fix required:**
In eco_fenets_runner.md, when the change involves both gate insertion AND rewire, classify it as "gate_insertion_with_rewire" or "new_logic_gate + rewire" in the RPT to clearly communicate to eco_netlist_studier that a new cell must be inserted, not just a net substituted.

---

## GAP-10 — 9899 MUX cascade priority inversion concern

**Severity:** LOW (pending FM validation)
**Observed in:** 9899 Step 1 gate chain analysis
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_netlist_studier.md`

**What happened:**
The MUX cascade (c_mux1→c_mux_final) has cond4 as outermost (highest priority in gate output) but RTL has cond1 as highest priority. If conditions cond1-cond4 are NOT mutually exclusive, the priority inversion would cause incorrect behavior. FM will validate equivalence.

**Fix required (if FM confirms FAIL on Synthesize due to this):**
Reverse the MUX cascade order in eco_netlist_studier so the outermost MUX checks the highest-priority RTL condition (cond1), not the lowest.

If FM passes → conditions are mutually exclusive and no fix needed. Document the finding either way after FM completes.

---

## GAP-11 — eco_pre_fm_checker JSON schema not followed by agent

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Observed in:** 9874 Step 5 — agent wrote simplified JSON missing check_summary, validator result
**File:** `config/eco_agents/eco_pre_fm_checker.md`

**What happened:**
The eco_pre_fm_checker agent ignored the JSON schema defined in STEP 4 and wrote its own simplified version (missing `check_summary`, `check8_verilog_validator`, `tag`, `attempts`, `issues_fixed`).

**Fix applied today:** Schema now at the TOP of the file as an output contract + mandatory self-check assertions before write + orchestrator validates schema on read.

**Status: FIXED today** — monitoring next runs to confirm.

---

## GAP-12 — Step 3 RPT showing `?` for signal names and scope

**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Observed in:** 9868 and 9899 Step 3 RPTs — showed `?` for all port_declaration signal names and `scope=?` for port_connections
**File:** `config/eco_agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md` (RPT generator)

**What happened:**
The ORCHESTRATOR's Step 3 RPT generator used `e.get('cell_name','?')` generically. For port_declaration entries, the key is `signal_name`. For port_connection, it's `instance_name`. Wrong keys → `?` everywhere in the RPT.

**Fix applied today:** RPT generator updated with per-change-type helper functions that use the correct field names.

**Status: FIXED today** — RPTs regenerated for 9868 and 9899 to confirm.
