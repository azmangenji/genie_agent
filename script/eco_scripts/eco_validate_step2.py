"""
eco_validate_step2.py — Deterministic Step 2 (fenets) validator.

Gates Step 3 handoff. Verifies that for every Mode-S anchor query the
deriver emitted (Cat 8), the raw FM rpt actually returned equivalence
data and the rename map captured per-stage wires.

Checks:
  C1: every Cat 8 query in <tag>_eco_fenets_queries.json appears as a
      `Net:` entry in any of the raw fenets rpts.
  C2: every Cat 8 query receives at least one `Equivalent Nets:` block
      (i.e. FM did NOT respond with FM-036 / Unknown name / empty).
  C3: optional — if eco_bridge_candidates.json exists, every anchor pin
      has at least one candidate with stages_available covering both
      PrePlace and Route.

Exit 0 = pass, 1 = fail. ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR blocks Step 3 handoff on fail.

    python3 eco_validate_step2.py \\
        --queries     data/<TAG>_eco_fenets_queries.json \\
