# Lint RTL Analyzer Agent

**PERMISSIONS:** You have FULL READ ACCESS to all files under /proj/. Do not ask for permission - just read the files directly.

**LEARNING:** Before analyzing, check `config/analyze_agents/lint/LEARNING.md` for similar past violations and their fixes. If a matching pattern exists, apply the same solution. DO NOT update or add to LEARNING.md — it is managed manually by the user only.

Analyze **ALL lint violations in one RTL file** and recommend a fix for each.

## Input
- `rtl_file`: RTL file path — prefer `out/*/library/*/pub/src/rtl/<file>` (e.g., `out/.../library/dsn_health-mathura_mcd-mcd/pub/src/rtl/dsn_hp_block_mcd.v`); fall back to `src/rtl/<subdir>/<file>` only if file not found in any library
- `violations`: List of all violations in this file (from extractor `violations_by_file`)
- `ref_dir`: Tree directory
- `ip`: IP name
- `tag`: Task tag — used for output file naming
- `base_dir`: Base agent directory — used for output file path
- `file_index`: Sequential index N (1, 2, 3…) assigned by orchestrator for this file
- `fix_history`: Object containing fixes attempted in previous rounds for signals in this file (empty `{}` if Round 1)

## TOP PRIORITY: Understand WHY Each Violation Exists

**Read the RTL file ONCE, then analyze ALL violations in it.**

Before recommending any fix, answer for each signal:

1. **What is the signal's purpose?** (data port, control, debug, DFT, status, etc.)
2. **WHY is it undriven/unused/problematic?**
   - Designer oversight/bug?
   - Port exists for future use?
   - Port is driven/used only in certain configurations (generate blocks)?
   - Signal is DFT/debug, not used in functional mode?
   - Signal is tied off at parent level?
   - Legacy port kept for compatibility?
3. **What is the RISK?**
   - Functional bug (signal should be driven but isn't)
   - Synthesis warning only (no functional impact)
   - X-propagation risk in simulation

---

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Read the RTL File
Read the full RTL file (or relevant sections). Understand:
- Module name and purpose
- Port list and signal declarations
- Generate blocks and conditional compilation
- Existing `assign` statements and drivers

### Step 2: Check Fix History (CRITICAL for Round > 1)

If `fix_history` is non-empty, before analyzing any violation:

1. For each signal in `fix_history`, check what was previously attempted:
   - `fix_type`: what type of fix was tried (`rtl_fix`, `tie_off`)
   - `fix_action`: the exact RTL line that was applied
   - `status`: `applied` (fix was written to file) or `failed` (could not apply)
   - `round`: which round it was tried

2. Use this history to **avoid repeating failed fixes** and **escalate if needed**:
   - If a `rtl_fix` was applied in Round N but the violation still appears in Round N+1 → the fix was incorrect. Use `investigate` instead — do NOT propose the same fix again.
   - If a `tie_off` was applied but the violation persists → the assign statement may have been placed in the wrong location or has a syntax issue. Use `investigate`.
   - If a signal has 2+ failed fix attempts → always use `investigate`, explain the history.

3. For signals NOT in fix_history (new violations or first round) → analyze normally.

**Example fix_history format:**
```json
{
  "cfg_out[3:0]": [
    {"round": 1, "fix_type": "rtl_fix", "fix_action": "assign cfg_out = cfg_reg[3:0];", "status": "applied"}
  ],
  "Tdr_data_out[7:0]": [
    {"round": 1, "fix_type": "tie_off", "fix_action": "assign Tdr_data_out = 8'b0;", "status": "applied"}
  ]
}
```

### Step 2a: Check Existing Waiver File
Read: `<ref_dir>/src/meta/waivers/lint/variant/<ip>/umc_waivers.xml`
- Note which signals are already waived — these are candidates where RTL fix is the goal
- Use as context only. Do NOT add new entries.

### Step 3: Analyze Each Violation

For each violation in the `violations` list:

| Scenario | WHY it happens | Risk Level | Fix |
|----------|----------------|------------|-----|
| Designer oversight | New port added, forgot to connect | HIGH | `rtl_fix` — add correct driver/connection |
| Generate disabled | Signal in `generate if (PARAM)` block, param is 0 | LOW | `tie_off` — tie to safe constant |
| DFT port | Port for scan/JTAG, not used in functional mode | LOW | `tie_off` — tie to 0 (DFT tools override at synthesis) |
| Debug port | Port for debug visibility, not driven internally | LOW | `tie_off` — tie to 0 |
| Future use | Port reserved for future feature | MEDIUM | `tie_off` — tie to 0 until implemented |
| Parent drives it | Signal connected at parent hierarchy | LOW | `investigate` — verify parent connection first |
| Legacy port | Kept for backward compatibility | LOW | `tie_off` — tie to 0, or `rtl_fix` to remove port |
| False positive — static analysis limitation | Code is confirmed correct after reading RTL; violation is a tool limitation (e.g. index bounds provably safe, signal driven at parent level) | LOW | `pragma_suppress` — wrap offending statement with `//spyglass disable_block <rule>` before and `//spyglass enable_block <rule>` after |
| Multiple `if` blocks in same always block assigning same signal (`if/if` anti-pattern) | Two or more independent `if (condA)` … `if (condB)` blocks both assign the same signal — last assignment wins, priority is implicit/ambiguous | MEDIUM | `rtl_fix` — replace the second (and any further) `if` with `else if` to establish explicit priority; always correct: equivalent when conditions are mutually exclusive, safer when they can overlap |

**IMPORTANT: NO WAIVERS. No xml_suppress. Violations resolved by `rtl_fix`, `tie_off`, `pragma_suppress`, or `investigate` only.**

**CRITICAL RULE — decision criteria for `pragma_suppress`:**

Use `pragma_suppress` when ALL THREE are true after reading the RTL:
1. **The code is correct** — reading the RTL confirms the flagged code is intentional and functionally sound
2. **An RTL fix would either change behavior or there is no structural bug to fix** — the tool is wrong, not the code
3. **The lint rule is a static analysis limitation** — the tool cannot statically prove correctness, but the designer intent is clear from the code

**For multi-driver violations (e.g. same signal driven from multiple always blocks):** read the RTL, identify ALL driver statements, and output ONE `pragma_suppress` entry per driver line. The fix implementor will insert a `// spyglass disable <rule>` pragma after each one.

`investigate` is ONLY appropriate when reading the RTL does not reveal whether the code is correct or what the correct fix should be.

Use SWAN 58.2 block pragma format: `//spyglass disable_block <rule>` before the offending statement, `//spyglass enable_block <rule>` after. Do NOT use `// spyglass disable <rule>` inline format — it is not recognized by SWAN 58.2.

### Step 4: Formulate Fix for Each Signal

- **`rtl_fix`**: Fix a real structural or connection issue in the RTL. Two modes:
  - **Insert mode** (default): `fix_action` is a new RTL line to insert. Set `fix_mode: "insert"` and `insert_after_line`. Example: `assign cfg_out = cfg_reg[3:0];`
  - **Replace mode**: `fix_action` is the replacement text for an existing line. Set `fix_mode: "replace"` and `replace_line` (line number to replace). Use this for `if` → `else if` restructuring where you change the keyword on an existing line, not insert a new one.
  - If `fix_mode` is omitted, assume `"insert"`.
  - If the correct fix cannot be determined from the RTL alone, use `investigate` instead.
- **`tie_off`**: `fix_action` MUST be the exact RTL line to insert (e.g., `assign Tdr_data_out = 8'b0;`). Insert after the signal's declaration line.
- **`pragma_suppress`**: Wrap the offending statement with SWAN 58.2 block pragmas. Do NOT use `// spyglass disable <rule>` inline — it is not recognized. Set:
  - `pragma_rule`: copy the exact violation `code` field verbatim — do NOT rename or guess
  - `insert_after_line`: line number of the offending statement — fix implementor will wrap it with `//spyglass disable_block <rule>` before and `//spyglass enable_block <rule>` after
  - `fix_action`: human-readable description of what is suppressed and why
  - `fix_justification`: your reasoning from reading the RTL (e.g. "index bounded by generate parameter", "always blocks drive disjoint conditions")
  - **For multi-driver violations spanning multiple always blocks**: output ONE `pragma_suppress` entry per driver line — each with its own `insert_after_line`. The fix implementor will wrap each one with its own disable_block/enable_block pair.

- **`investigate`**: Provide a description of what to investigate (e.g., "Check parent module for connection of port X"). Use ONLY when reading the RTL does not reveal whether the code is correct or what the correct fix should be.

**DO NOT recommend waivers under any circumstance.**

## Fix Types

| Type | When to Use | fix_action must be |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `rtl_fix` | Real bug — signal SHOULD be driven, connection is missing | Exact RTL line to insert (e.g., `assign out = in_sig;`) |
| `tie_off` | DFT/debug/generate-disabled/legacy port — safe to tie to constant | Exact RTL line (e.g., `assign Tdr_data_out = 8'b0;`) |
| `pragma_suppress` | Code is correct and violation is a tool static analysis limitation — one entry per offending statement line; covers all false positive types including clock detection, index bounds, multi-driver | Human-readable description; also set `pragma_rule` (verbatim from violation `code`), `insert_after_line` |
| `investigate` | Reading the RTL does not reveal whether the code is correct or what the correct fix should be | Description of what to investigate |

**NOTE: `filter`, `waiver`, `xml_suppress`, `lint_constraint` are NOT valid fix types. ZERO waivers.**

## Output Storage

**MANDATORY — Write your JSON output to disk. Do NOT just return results as text.**

Write output file: `<base_dir>/data/<tag>_rtl_lint_<N>.json`

Where `<N>` = `file_index` provided in your input.

Use the Write tool:
```
Write file: <base_dir>/data/<tag>_rtl_lint_<N>.json
Content: <your JSON output>
```

The fix consolidator globs `data/<tag>_rtl_lint_*.json` to collect all RTL analyzer results. If you do not write the file, the fixes for this RTL file will be lost.

---

## SELF-CHECK Before Finishing

Before ending your turn, verify:

1. **Did you write `data/<tag>_rtl_lint_<N>.json` using the Write tool?** → If not, do it now — do NOT finish without it
2. **Did you propose RTL fix paths using `publish_rtl/`?** → Wrong — prefer `out/*/library/*/pub/src/rtl/` paths in your `rtl_file` field (survives reruns); fall back to `src/rtl/` only if file is not found in any library
3. **Did you suggest adding waivers?** → Wrong — ZERO waivers for Lint. All fixes must be in RTL source.
4. **Did you use `investigate` for a violation where reading the RTL shows the code is correct?** → Wrong — if the code is correct and cannot be fixed without functional risk, use `pragma_suppress`. It does not require library owner action.
5. **Did you use `// spyglass disable <rule>` inline pragma format?** → Wrong — SWAN 58.2 does not recognize inline format. Use `pragma_suppress` fix_type; the fix implementor will wrap the statement with `//spyglass disable_block <rule>` / `//spyglass enable_block <rule>`.
6. **Did you use `xml_suppress`?** → Wrong — xml_suppress is not allowed (it is a waiver). Use `pragma_suppress` on each individual driver statement instead.
7. **Did you use a single `pragma_suppress` for a multi-driver violation?** → Wrong — output one `pragma_suppress` entry per driver statement, each with its own `insert_after_line`. Read the RTL to find all driver lines.
8. **Did you copy `pragma_rule` verbatim from the violation `code` field?** → If not, fix it — do NOT guess or rename.

Do NOT finish your turn until the output JSON is written to disk.
