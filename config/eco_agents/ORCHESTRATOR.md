# ECO Analyze Orchestrator Guide

**You are the ECO orchestrator agent.** The main Claude session has spawned you to execute the full ECO analyze flow. Your inputs (TAG, REF_DIR, TILE, LOG_FILE, SPEC_FILE) were passed in your prompt.

> **MANDATORY FIRST ACTION:** Read `config/eco_agents/CRITICAL_RULES.md` in full before doing anything else. Every rule in that file addresses a known failure mode. Acknowledge each rule before proceeding to RESUMPTION CHECK.

**Working directory:** Always `cd` to the directory containing `runs/` and `data/` (the BASE_DIR = parent of LOG_FILE's `runs/` folder) before any file operations.

**Inputs also include JIRA number** — used for naming new_logic ECO cells: `eco_<jira>_<seq>` and nets: `n_eco_<jira>_<seq>`.

**SCOPE RESTRICTION — CRITICAL:** Only read agent guidance files from `config/eco_agents/`. Do NOT read from `config/analyze_agents/` — those files govern static check analysis (CDC/RDC, Lint, SpgDFT) and contain rules that are wrong for ECO gate-level netlist editing. In particular, `config/analyze_agents/shared/CRITICAL_RULES.md` does NOT apply to this flow.

---

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **No hardcoded signal names** — all net names come from RTL diff output
2. **Instance names, NOT module names** — hierarchy paths use instance names (e.g., `INST_A`, `INST_B`) not module names (`module_a`, `module_b`)
3. **Study PreEco before touching PostEco** — always read PreEco netlist first to confirm cell+pin
4. **Single-occurrence rule** — if old_net appears >1 time on a pin in PostEco, skip and report AMBIGUOUS
5. **Backup always** — `cp PostEco/${stage}.v.gz PostEco/${stage}.v.gz.bak_${tag}_round${round}` before any edit (round-specific backup so each round can be independently reverted)
6. **new_logic = cell insertion** — when new_net doesn't exist in PostEco, insert a new cell: inverter (Step 4 (eco_applier)) for simple inversion, DFF (Step 4 (eco_applier)-DFF) for sequential registers, or combinational gate (Step 4 (eco_applier)-GATE) for multi-input logic. FM auto-matches inserted cells by instance path name.
7. **Polarity rule** — only use `+` (non-inverted) impl nets for rewiring, never `-` (inverted); for inverted signals use new_logic insert
8. **Bus dual-query** — for bus signals `reg [N:0] X`, query both `X` and `X_0_` to find gate-level name
9. **PostEco FM verification — ONE run only** — run all 3 targets in Step 6. If FM fails: write round_handoff.json → spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR → HARD STOP. Never re-run FM or loop within ORCHESTRATOR. Each subsequent FM run belongs to its own ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR instance.
10. **6-round fix loop** — each round = one eco_applier run + one FM run. Round 1 is in ORCHESTRATOR. Rounds 2–6 are in separate ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR instances. One ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR = one FM run, then spawn next agent.
11. **Same instance name across all stages** — new_logic cells must use identical instance names in Synthesize, PrePlace, and Route for FM stage-to-stage matching
12. **Output file verification** — after every sub-agent completes, verify the expected output file exists and is non-empty before proceeding to the next step. Never assume a sub-agent succeeded without checking.
13. **Email before proceeding** — every round email (Step 6a) and the final email (Step 8) are MANDATORY. Verify "Email sent successfully" in the output before continuing.
14. **Fixer state integrity** — always save `eco_fixer_state` with the incremented round number before looping back to Step 4. Never start a new round without updating fixer_state first.
15. **Never skip a step** — each step must fully complete and its checkpoint must pass before the next step begins. Context pressure is NOT a valid reason to skip a step or checkpoint.

---

## RESUMPTION CHECK — BEFORE PRE-FLIGHT

> **Root cause this solves:** The ORCHESTRATOR agent can exhaust its context window after eco_fm_runner returns and after writing round_handoff.json + eco_fixer_state, but BEFORE it can make the Agent() tool call to spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR. Both state files are written but the spawn never happens. This check detects that situation and completes the spawn on restart.

**Check for existing round_handoff.json FIRST — before PRE-FLIGHT, before any step:**

```bash
ls data/<TAG>_round_handoff.json 2>/dev/null && echo EXISTS
```

**If `round_handoff.json` EXISTS:**

Read it and branch immediately:

| `status` field | `eco_fixer_state` exists? | Action |
|----------------|--------------------------|--------|
| `FM_FAILED` | YES | Spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR → HARD STOP |
| `FM_FAILED` | NO | Something is wrong — write eco_fixer_state from round_handoff data (round=1, failing_targets from eco_fm_verify.json), then spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR → HARD STOP |
| `FM_PASSED` | — | Spawn FINAL_ORCHESTRATOR → HARD STOP |
| `FM_FAILED` (pre_fm_check_failed=true) | YES | Spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR → HARD STOP |

**SKIP ALL STEPS including PRE-FLIGHT** when any row above matches — the flow is already complete up to the spawn. Do NOT re-run Steps 1–6.

**If `round_handoff.json` does NOT exist:** Continue normally to PRE-FLIGHT below.

---

## PRE-FLIGHT

**Rule loading for this flow:** This flow does NOT use `config/analyze_agents/shared/CRITICAL_RULES.md`. Do NOT read it. Do NOT prepend it to sub-agent prompts. The only guidance files for this flow are the md files inside `config/eco_agents/`. If you have read `config/analyze_agents/ORCHESTRATOR.md`, discard its Pre-Flight instructions — they do not apply here.

Before any step:
1. `cd <BASE_DIR>` (parent of `runs/` folder from LOG_FILE)
2. `cd <REF_DIR>` to verify it exists
3. Confirm `data/PreEco/SynRtl/` and `data/SynRtl/` both exist
4. Return to BASE_DIR
5. Write `data/<TAG>_eco_analyze` metadata file:
   ```
   tile=<TILE>
   ref_dir=<REF_DIR>
   tag=<TAG>
   jira=<JIRA>
   ```
6. Create the AI ECO flow directory at REF_DIR and set `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`:
   ```bash
   AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR=<REF_DIR>/AI_ECO_FLOW_<TAG>
   mkdir -p <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>
   ```
   This directory collects all step RPTs in one place under REF_DIR for easy access.

   > **ANTI-PATTERN WARNING:** REF_DIR may contain older `AI_ECO_FLOW_<OLDER_TAG>/` directories from previous runs. Do NOT read, copy, or reuse any files from those directories. They belong to different TAGs and their fenets results, netlist study JSONs, and ECO applied JSONs are NOT valid inputs for this run. Step 2 (find_equivalent_nets) MUST always be submitted fresh for a new TAG — never skipped by copying RPTs from a pre-existing `AI_ECO_FLOW_*` directory. Treat all older `AI_ECO_FLOW_*` directories as read-only historical artifacts that do not affect this run.

---

## STEP 1 — RTL Diff Analysis

**Spawn a sub-agent (general-purpose)** with the content of `config/eco_agents/rtl_diff_analyzer.md` prepended to the prompt. Pass:
- `REF_DIR`, `TILE`, `TAG`, `BASE_DIR`, `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`
- Task: Run RTL diff, extract changed signals, determine nets to query, build verified hierarchy paths
- Output: `data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json`

Wait for the sub-agent to complete and read `data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json`.

**CHECKPOINT:** Verify `data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json` exists and contains at least one entry in `changes[]` and `nets_to_query[]` before proceeding. If missing or empty — the sub-agent failed. Do NOT continue to Step 2.

---

## STEP 2 — Run find_equivalent_nets

**Spawn a sub-agent (general-purpose)** with the content of `config/eco_agents/eco_fenets_runner.md` prepended. Pass:
- `TAG`, `REF_DIR`, `TILE`, `BASE_DIR`, `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`
- Path to RTL diff JSON: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json`
- Task: validate nets, submit fenets, block until complete, handle all retries, write all raw rpts + step2 fenets RPT

Wait for the sub-agent to complete.

**CHECKPOINT — Verify ALL of the following before proceeding to Step 3:**
```bash
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<fenets_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw.rpt
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<TAG>_eco_step2_fenets.rpt
```
If any file is missing — eco_fenets_runner failed. Do NOT continue.

**Extract SPEC_SOURCES from `data/<TAG>_eco_step2_fenets.rpt`** (read the SPEC_SOURCES section at the bottom of the RPT) — pass these to the Step 3 sub-agent prompt.

---

### Step 2 Notes (reference — do NOT execute yourself)

Full implementation is in `eco_fenets_runner.md`. Key rules for the sub-agent:
- Validate nets (filter port_promotion/new_port/port_connection types)
- Do NOT reuse previous run scope — submit fresh if paths differ
- No-Equiv-Nets retry: always DEEPER (not shallower)
- FM-036 retry: classify first using `grep -rn "^\s*(input|output)\b.*<old_token>" PreEco/SynRtl/` — if matches found → port-level signal → strip one hierarchy level per retry (going shallower, max 3 retries); if zero matches → internal wire → pivot immediately to target register query (single pivot attempt, no level-stripping)
- Poll every 5 minutes with individual Bash tool calls (one tool call per poll interval — keeps main session responsive, showing "Running..." instead of "Sublimating..." for hours)
- Copy all rpts to AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR before exiting

The following detail is for sub-agent reference. **Validate `nets_to_query` before submitting.** Whether Step 1 was just run or reused from a previous tag, always check the JSON before building the net list:

```python
# Load the RTL diff JSON
rtl_diff = load("<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json")

# Collect all valid signal names to query: only old_token and new_token from wire_swap/and_term changes
# port_promotion, new_port, port_connection changes have no FM query — skip them
no_fm_types = {"port_promotion", "new_port", "port_connection"}

valid_tokens = set()
for c in rtl_diff["changes"]:
    if c.get("change_type") in no_fm_types:
        continue   # these change types never generate FM queries
    if c.get("old_token"): valid_tokens.add(c["old_token"])
    if c.get("new_token"): valid_tokens.add(c["new_token"])

# Keep only nets whose signal name (last path component, strip _0_ bus suffix) matches a valid token
def net_signal(net_path):
    name = net_path.split("/")[-1]
    return name[:-3] if name.endswith("_0_") else name  # strip bus suffix if present

valid_nets = [n for n in rtl_diff["nets_to_query"]
              if net_signal(n["net_path"]) in valid_tokens]
```

If any `nets_to_query` entry does not correspond to `old_token` or `new_token` from the change list, **drop it silently** — do NOT submit it to FM. Only `old_token` and `new_token` nets are valid queries. This validation catches bugs from reused Step 1 results that predate the current md rules.

**MANDATORY: Do NOT reuse a previous fenets run if its queried scope differs from Step 1 `net_path` values.**

When considering reusing a previous tag's fenets results, compare the net paths that tag actually queried against the `net_path` values in `nets_to_query` from the Step 1 JSON. If they differ (e.g., previous run used a deeper or shallower hierarchy than Step 1 specifies), do NOT reuse it as the initial fenets — they are different scopes. Submit a fresh fenets using the Step 1 paths. A previous run at a different hierarchy level may only be used as a **retry result** (see retry strategy below), not as the initial run.

**MANDATORY: All retry rpt files MUST be copied to `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR` before proceeding to Step 3.** If a retry was submitted but its raw rpt is not yet in `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`, wait for it and copy it. Do not proceed with an incomplete retry.

**MANDATORY: No-Equiv-Nets retry direction is always DEEPER (add sub-instance level), never shallower.**
- Initial query: `<net_path>` from Step 1 (declaring module scope)
- Retry 1: add one sub-instance level deeper than the initial path
- Retry 2: add one more sub-instance level deeper than retry 1
Going shallower (removing a hierarchy level from the initial path) is NOT a valid No-Equiv-Nets retry. If a previous run's query is already at a deeper level than Step 1's `net_path`, treat that previous run as a retry result — NOT as the initial run.

The sequence below is strictly sequential — each step BLOCKS on the previous. Do NOT submit a retry before the current run is complete and its raw rpt is written and copied.

### Phase A — Initial Run (BLOCKING)

**A1. Submit:**
```bash
cd <BASE_DIR>
python3 script/genie_cli.py \
  -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<net1>,<net2>,..." \
  --execute --xterm
```
Read `<fenets_tag>` from CLI output (`Tag: <fenets_tag>`).

**A2. Wait — poll every 2 minutes until `FIND_EQUIVALENT_NETS_COMPLETE` appears in ALL 3 rpt files (60-min timeout):**
```bash
grep -c "FIND_EQUIVALENT_NETS_COMPLETE" \
  <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<fenets_tag>.txt \
  <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<fenets_tag>.txt \
  <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<fenets_tag>.txt
```
**Do NOT proceed until all 3 show count=1.** Do NOT poll `data/<fenets_tag>_spec` — the rpt files are authoritative.

**A3. Read — once all 3 sentinel counts = 1:**
```bash
cat <BASE_DIR>/data/<fenets_tag>_spec
```

**A4. Write and copy raw rpt immediately:**
```bash
{
  echo "FIND EQUIVALENT NETS — RAW FM OUTPUT"
  echo "fenets_tag: <fenets_tag>  |  TAG: <TAG>  |  Tile: <TILE>"
  echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl"
  cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<fenets_tag>.txt
  echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize"
  cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<fenets_tag>.txt
  echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace"
  cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<fenets_tag>.txt
} > <BASE_DIR>/data/<fenets_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw.rpt
cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<fenets_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
```

**A5. Verify copy succeeded:**
```bash
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<fenets_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw.rpt
```
If missing — re-run the cp before continuing.

**A6. NOW analyze the raw rpt** — only after A1–A5 are complete:
- For each stage, check the results: FM found cells / No Equivalent Nets / FM-036
- Identify which stages and nets need retries (No-Equiv-Nets or FM-036)
- **Do NOT submit any retry until this analysis is done**

---

### Phase B — Retries (each retry is its own BLOCKING cycle)

For each stage/net that requires a retry (No-Equiv-Nets or FM-036), repeat this pattern — **one retry at a time, sequentially**:

**B1. Submit retry:**
```bash
python3 script/genie_cli.py \
  -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<retry_net_path>" \
  --execute --xterm
```
Read `<retry_tag>` from CLI output.

**B2. Wait — same polling pattern as A2, using `<retry_tag>`:**
```bash
grep -c "FIND_EQUIVALENT_NETS_COMPLETE" \
  <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt \
  <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt \
  <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
```
**Do NOT proceed until all 3 = 1.**

**B3. Read:** `cat <BASE_DIR>/data/<retry_tag>_spec`

**B4. Write and copy retry raw rpt immediately (with type suffix):**
```bash
{
  echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl"
  cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
  echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize"
  cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
  echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace"
  cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
} > <BASE_DIR>/data/<retry_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_<type>_retry<N>.rpt
cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<retry_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_<type>_retry<N>.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
```
Where `<type>` = `noequiv` or `fm036`, `<N>` = retry number.

**B5. Verify copy:** `ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<retry_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_<type>_retry<N>.rpt`

**B6. Analyze retry results** — only then decide if another retry is needed.

**Repeat B1–B6 for each additional retry, one at a time.**

   Write `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_step2_fenets.rpt` using this format:

   ```
   ================================================================================
   STEP 2 — FIND EQUIVALENT NETS
   Tag: <TAG>  |  fenets_tag: <fenets_tag>  |  Tile: <TILE>
   ================================================================================

   <For each net queried, one block:>
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Net [<n>/<total>]: <net_path>
   ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   RTL Context   : <change_type> in <module_name> — <old_token> → <new_token>

   <If "No Equivalent Nets" 2nd iteration was performed for any stage:>
   2nd Iteration (No Equiv Nets Retry):
     Original query : <original_net_path> → No Equivalent Nets in <Stage>
     Retry 1 (<noequiv_retry1_tag>): <retry1_net_path> → <FOUND <N> cells / Still no results>
     Retry 2 (<noequiv_retry2_tag>): <retry2_net_path> → <FOUND <N> cells / All retries exhausted>
     Outcome        : <Used retry <N> results for <Stage> / Stage fallback applied>

   <If FM-036 pivot to target register was performed:>
   FM-036 Internal Wire Pivot:
     Failing net    : <original_net_path> → FM-036 at all hierarchy levels (internal wire)
     Classification : Internal wire — not a module port, invisible to FM at any depth
     Pivot query    : <target_register_path> → <FOUND <N> cells / FM-036 again>
     Outcome        : <Used pivot results — backward cone trace identifies MUX/cell to rewire>

   FM Results per Stage:
     [Synthesize] : <N> qualifying cells  (or: No Equiv Nets → retry<N> used / fallback)
     [PrePlace]   : <N> qualifying cells  (or: No Equiv Nets → retry<N> used / fallback)
     [Route]      : <N> qualifying cells  (or: FM-036 → stripped path / fallback)

   Qualifying cells passed to Step 3:
     Synthesize : <cell_name>/<pin>, ...
     PrePlace   : <cell_name>/<pin>, ...  (or: fallback from Synthesize)
     Route      : <cell_name>/<pin>, ...  (or: fallback from Synthesize)

   <Repeat for each net>
   ================================================================================
   ```

   After writing, copy it:
   ```bash
   cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_step2_fenets.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
   ```

**CHECKPOINT — STRICT FILE VERIFICATION before proceeding to Step 3:**

Every raw rpt file that was written to `data/` MUST also exist in `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR/`. Verify each one individually:

```bash
# Initial run — MUST exist
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<fenets_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw.rpt

# Each No-Equiv-Nets retry submitted — MUST exist (if retry was run)
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<noequiv_retry1_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry1.rpt
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<noequiv_retry2_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry2.rpt

# Each FM-036 retry submitted — MUST exist (if retry was run)
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<fm036_retry1_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_fm036_retry1.rpt
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<fm036_retry2_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_fm036_retry2.rpt
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<fm036_retry3_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_fm036_retry3.rpt

# Step 2 summary RPT — MUST exist
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<TAG>_eco_step2_fenets.rpt
```

If ANY submitted run's raw rpt is missing from `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`, **copy it before proceeding**:
```bash
cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw*.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
```

**Do NOT proceed to Step 3 if any submitted run's raw rpt is absent from `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`.** A missing file means either the copy was skipped or the run did not complete — investigate before continuing.

**MANDATORY: Retries MUST be attempted before fallback.** Do NOT skip straight to Stage Fallback or grep fallback when FM returns No Equivalent Nets or FM-036. The retry strategies below are NOT optional — they must be executed in order. Only after all retries are exhausted may fallback be applied.

**For FM-036 retries**, submit a new genie_cli.py call with the stripped net path — each retry gets its own tag, read from CLI output:
   ```bash
   python3 script/genie_cli.py \
     -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<stripped_net_path>" \
     --execute --xterm
   ```

### "No Equivalent Nets" Retry Strategy  ← MANDATORY before Stage Fallback

If a stage returns `--- No Equivalent Nets:` (not FM-036 — the net path was valid but FM found no gate-level equivalents):

**You MUST attempt the retries below before applying Stage Fallback.** Skipping retries and going directly to fallback is a protocol violation — retries resolve the issue when the queried hierarchy path is at the wrong level relative to where the signal is visible in FM's reference namespace.

This happens when:
- The hierarchy path is at the wrong level (too high or too low)
- The P&R stage restructured the signal into HFS aliases not visible at the queried scope

**Retry steps (max 2 retries, each gets its own genie_cli call):**

1. **Retry with deeper hierarchy** — add one more instance level from the declaring module trace (e.g., `<INST_A>/<signal>` → `<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<signal>` if `<INST_B>` is the sub-module containing the declaration):
   ```bash
   python3 script/genie_cli.py \
     -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<deeper_net_path>" \
     --execute --xterm
   ```
   Read new `<noequiv_retry1_tag>` from CLI output. Poll rpt files for sentinel. Once complete:
   ```bash
   # Write and copy raw rpt for this retry
   {
     echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl"
     cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<noequiv_retry1_tag>.txt
     echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize"
     cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<noequiv_retry1_tag>.txt
     echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace"
     cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<noequiv_retry1_tag>.txt
   } > <BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry1_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry1.rpt
   cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry1_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry1.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
   ```
   Read results from `<BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry1_tag>_spec`. If results found → use them and stop retrying.

2. **Retry with yet deeper hierarchy (retry 2)** — add one more sub-instance level beyond retry 1's path. Going shallower (stripping a level) is NEVER valid for No-Equiv-Nets — it moves further from the declaring module, which makes FM's scope wider and less precise, not more:
   ```bash
   python3 script/genie_cli.py \
     -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<even_deeper_net_path>" \
     --execute --xterm
   ```
   Read new `<noequiv_retry2_tag>` from CLI output. Same output handling as retry 1:
   ```bash
   # Write and copy raw rpt
   { ... } > <BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry2_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry2.rpt
   cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry2_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry2.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
   ```
   Read results from `<BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry2_tag>_spec`.

**Output files per retry:**
- `data/<noequiv_retry<N>_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_noequiv_retry<N>.rpt` — raw FM output for each No-Equiv-Nets retry (N=1,2)
- Copied to `<AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/` alongside the main fenets raw rpt
- The `_noequiv_retry<N>` suffix distinguishes these from FM-036 retries at a glance
- Referenced in `data/<TAG>_eco_step2_fenets.rpt` with note: `NO_EQUIV_NETS retry<N> tag: <noequiv_retry<N>_tag>`

**If all retries still return "No Equivalent Nets":**
- Apply Stage Fallback in Step 3 (eco_netlist_studier) — grep confirmed cell names from another stage
- Record reason in step2 fenets rpt: `NO_EQUIV_NETS — all retries exhausted, fallback required for <Stage>`

---

### FM-036 Fallback Strategy

If any net returns `Error: Unknown name ... (FM-036)`:

1. **Bus variant already pre-queried** — the rtl_diff_analyzer sends both `X` and `X_0_` upfront, so the result is already in the same run. Check the other variant's result before doing anything else.

1b. **Classify the FM-036 cause BEFORE stripping hierarchy levels:**

   FM-036 has two distinct root causes that require different strategies:

   | Cause | Symptom | Correct Action |
   |-------|---------|----------------|
   | **Wrong hierarchy level** — net IS a module port, just queried at wrong depth | FM-036 fires at this level but net exists as a port at another level | Strip/add levels (step 2 below) |
   | **Internal wire** — net is a submodule-internal wire, NOT a module port | FM-036 fires at ALL hierarchy levels — the net is never exposed in FM's reference namespace | Skip level-stripping; **PIVOT to target register query** (step 2b below) |

   **How to classify — grep the PreEco RTL files:**
   ```bash
   grep -rn "^\s*\(input\|output\)\b.*<old_token>" <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/SynRtl/
   ```
   - If this grep returns at least one match → `old_token` is declared as `input` or `output` in some module's port list → it is a **port-level signal** → use step 2 (strip one hierarchy level per retry, max 3 retries)
   - If this grep returns zero matches → `old_token` is never declared as a module port (only as `reg`/`wire` inside a module) → it is an **internal wire** → use step 2b immediately (pivot to target register query — do NOT submit any level-stripping retries)

2b. **Pivot to target register query (when net is an internal wire):**

   When the failing net is an internal wire inside a submodule (not a port at any hierarchy level), FM will return FM-036 at every depth. Do NOT waste retries stripping levels. Instead:

   - Read `target_register` from `eco_rtl_diff.json` for this `wire_swap` change
   - Query the **output signal of the target register** — this IS visible to FM as a named RTL signal:
   ```bash
   python3 script/genie_cli.py \
     -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<hierarchy_path>/<target_register>" \
     --execute --xterm
   ```
   Where `<hierarchy_path>` is the instance path of the module containing `target_register` (from `hierarchy` field in `eco_rtl_diff.json`).

   **Why this works:** FM's reference namespace exposes the register's output signal (the Q net). The eco_netlist_studier will then trace backward from `<target_register>.D` through the gate-level backward cone to find the actual cell and pin that drives the D input — which is where the internal wire (`old_net`) connects. The backward cone trace (in eco_netlist_studier.md) identifies the exact cell to rewire without needing FM to directly name the internal wire.

   Write and copy the raw rpt with the `_fm036_retry<N>` suffix as normal.

   **If the target register pivot also returns FM-036:** try the register name with `_reg` suffix appended, then with a `_0_` bus notation, then apply direct netlist grep (step 3).

2. **Retry find_equivalent_nets with parent hierarchy (for port-level signals only)** — strip one level from the failing net path and submit a new genie_cli.py call:
   ```bash
   # Original failed: <PARENT_INST>/<CHILD_INST>/<net>
   # Retry with:      <PARENT_INST>/<net>
   python3 script/genie_cli.py \
     -i "find equivalent nets at <REF_DIR> for <TILE> netName:<stripped_net_path>" \
     --execute --xterm
   ```
   Read the new tag from CLI output. Poll the rpt files (NOT the spec file) for the sentinel, same as the main run:
   ```bash
   grep -c "FIND_EQUIVALENT_NETS_COMPLETE" \
     <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt \
     <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt \
     <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
   ```
   Once all 3 rpt files have the sentinel, read results from `<BASE_DIR>/data/<retry_tag>_spec`.
   Write and copy the raw rpt with the retry number suffix:
   ```bash
   {
     echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl"
     cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
     echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize"
     cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
     echo "TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace"
     cat <REF_DIR>/rpts/FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace/find_equivalent_nets_<retry_tag>.txt
   } > <BASE_DIR>/data/<retry_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_fm036_retry<N>.rpt
   cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<retry_tag>_find_equivalent_nets_raw_fm036_retry<N>.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
   ```
   Where N=1 for first retry, N=2 for second, N=3 for third. The `_fm036_retry<N>` suffix distinguishes these from No-Equiv-Nets retries — both can coexist in the same run without ambiguity.

   **Retry loop rules:**
   - Max **3 retries** (`_retry1`, `_retry2`, `_retry3`) — but only for **port-level signals** (step 2 above). For **internal wires**, use the target register pivot (step 2b) instead — do NOT waste retries stripping levels.
   - Stop early if the net path has no more `/` — there is no parent level left to try
   - Each retry strips one more hierarchy level from the previous attempt's path
   - If any retry returns a valid impl cell+pin → use it and stop retrying. FM gives the exact gate-level cell name and pin, which is more reliable than grep.
   - **If FM-036 fires at EVERY level after 2 retries:** stop stripping. The net is likely an internal wire — apply step 2b (target register pivot) even if you initially treated it as a port-level signal.

3. **Direct netlist grep** — only if FM retry also fails or times out:
   ```bash
   zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep -n "<net_token>"
   ```
   `<net_token>` is the signal name extracted from the failing net path. This finds what it is called in gate-level (may have `_reg` suffix or synthesis renaming).

4. **Use RTL diff context** — if grep finds no match, search by structural proximity (surrounding expression from the diff hunk) to identify the relevant cell.

5. **Mark as `fm_failed`** and rely on Step 3 direct netlist study — do NOT abort the flow. A single failed net does not stop the whole ECO.

## STEP 3 — Study PreEco Gate-Level Netlist

**Spawn a sub-agent (general-purpose)** with the content of `config/eco_agents/eco_netlist_studier.md` prepended. Pass:
- `REF_DIR`, `TAG`, `BASE_DIR`, `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`
- The RTL diff JSON at `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json` (provides old_net/new_net per change)
- **ALL spec file paths** from Step 2 — initial run AND every retry:
  - Initial: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<fenets_tag>_spec`
  - No-Equiv-Nets retries: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry1_tag>_spec`, `<BASE_DIR>/data/<noequiv_retry2_tag>_spec` (if they exist)
  - FM-036 retries: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<fm036_retry1_tag>_spec`, `<BASE_DIR>/data/<fm036_retry2_tag>_spec`, `<BASE_DIR>/data/<fm036_retry3_tag>_spec` (if they exist)
- **Per-stage spec source mapping** — build and pass to Step 3 which spec file to use for each stage.

  **How to build SPEC_SOURCES (algorithm):**
  ```python
  # Start: all stages use initial run spec
  spec_sources = {
      "Synthesize": f"{BASE_DIR}/data/{fenets_tag}_spec",
      "PrePlace":   f"{BASE_DIR}/data/{fenets_tag}_spec",
      "Route":      f"{BASE_DIR}/data/{fenets_tag}_spec",
  }

  # For each No-Equiv-Nets retry that was run:
  for retry_tag, retry_spec_path in noequiv_retries:   # in order retry1, retry2
      retry_raw = read_raw_rpt(retry_tag)
      for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
          if stage_has_qualifying_cells(retry_raw, stage):
              spec_sources[stage] = f"{BASE_DIR}/data/{retry_tag}_spec"
              break   # first retry that resolved this stage wins

  # For each FM-036 retry:
  for retry_tag, retry_spec_path in fm036_retries:
      retry_raw = read_raw_rpt(retry_tag)
      for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
          if stage_has_qualifying_cells(retry_raw, stage):
              spec_sources[stage] = f"{BASE_DIR}/data/{retry_tag}_spec"
              break

  # Mark stages with no FM results as FALLBACK
  for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
      initial_raw = read_raw_rpt(fenets_tag)
      if not stage_has_qualifying_cells(initial_raw, stage) and spec_sources[stage] == initial_spec:
          spec_sources[stage] = "FALLBACK"
  ```

  Where `stage_has_qualifying_cells(raw_rpt, stage)` = True if the raw rpt for that stage returns at least one `(+)` impl cell/pin pair (not FM-036 and not No Equivalent Nets).

  Pass the final mapping:
  ```
  SPEC_SOURCES:
    Synthesize: <resolved_spec_path_or_FALLBACK>
    PrePlace:   <resolved_spec_path_or_FALLBACK>
    Route:      <resolved_spec_path_or_FALLBACK>
  ```
  This prevents Step 3 from reading the wrong spec for a given stage — each stage uses the spec from the run that actually resolved its results.
- Task: For each impl cell in FM output, find instantiation in PreEco netlist, extract port connections, confirm old_net on expected pin
- Output: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json`

Format of output (each stage array may contain both wire_swap rewire entries AND new_logic_insertion entries):
```json
{
  "Synthesize": [
    {
      "change_type": "rewire",
      "cell_name": "<from FM output>",
      "pin": "<pin from FM output>",
      "old_net": "<from RTL diff>",
      "new_net": "<from RTL diff>",
      "new_net_alias": null,
      "line_context": "<surrounding verilog lines>",
      "confirmed": true
    },
    {
      "change_type": "new_logic_dff",
      "target_register": "<signal_name>",
      "instance_scope": "<INST_A>/<INST_B>",
      "cell_type": "<DFF_cell_type>",
      "instance_name": "eco_<jira>_<seq>",
      "output_net": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>",
      "port_connections": {"CK": "<clk>", "D": "<data>", "RN": "<reset>", "Q": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>"},
      "input_from_change": null,
      "confirmed": true
    },
    {
      "change_type": "new_logic_gate",
      "target_register": "<output_signal>",
      "instance_scope": "<INST_A>/<INST_B>",
      "cell_type": "<gate_cell_type>",
      "instance_name": "eco_<jira>_<seq>",
      "output_net": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>",
      "gate_function": "<NAND2|NOR2|AND2|...>",
      "port_connections": {"A": "<input1>", "B": "<input2>", "ZN": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>"},
      "input_from_change": null,
      "confirmed": true
    }
  ],
  "PrePlace": [...],
  "Route": [...]
}
```

**CHECKPOINT:** Verify `data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json` exists and has non-empty arrays for all 3 stages (Synthesize, PrePlace, Route) before proceeding. If missing or all stages empty — the sub-agent failed. Do NOT continue to Step 4.

**Generate Step 3 RPT from JSON (ORCHESTRATOR responsibility):**

Read `data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json` and write `data/<TAG>_eco_step3_netlist_study_round1.rpt`:

```python
def entry_label(e, stage):
    """Return the human-readable identifier for a study entry."""
    ct = e.get("change_type", "")
    if ct == "rewire":
        return e.get("per_stage_cell_name", {}).get(stage) or e.get("cell_name", "?")
    if ct in ("port_declaration", "port_promotion"):
        return e.get("signal_name", "?")
    return e.get("instance_name") or e.get("cell_name") or e.get("signal_name", "?")

def entry_detail(e, stage):
    """Return a one-line detail string showing the key fields per change_type."""
    ct = e.get("change_type", "")
    if ct == "rewire":
        return f"pin={e.get('pin','?')}  {e.get('old_net','?')} → {e.get('new_net','?')}  scope={e.get('instance_scope','?')}"
    if ct in ("new_logic_gate", "new_logic"):
        return f"fn={e.get('gate_function','?')}  out={e.get('output_net','?')}  scope={e.get('instance_scope','?')}"
    if ct == "new_logic_dff":
        return f"reg={e.get('target_register','?')}  out={e.get('output_net','?')}  scope={e.get('instance_scope','?')}"
    if ct in ("port_declaration", "port_promotion"):
        return f"module={e.get('module_name','?')}  dir={e.get('declaration_type','output')}"
    if ct == "port_connection":
        return f".{e.get('port_name','?')}({e.get('net_name','?')})  parent={e.get('parent_module','?')}"
    return ""

study = load("data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json")
with open("data/<TAG>_eco_step3_netlist_study_round1.rpt", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"STEP 3 — PREECO NETLIST STUDY\nTag: <TAG>  |  JIRA: <JIRA>  |  Tile: <TILE>\n{'='*80}\n\n")
    for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
        confirmed = [e for e in study.get(stage, []) if e.get("confirmed")]
        excluded  = [e for e in study.get(stage, []) if not e.get("confirmed")]
        f.write(f"[{stage}] — {len(confirmed)} confirmed, {len(excluded)} excluded\n")
        for e in confirmed:
            label  = entry_label(e, stage)
            detail = entry_detail(e, stage)
            f.write(f"  CONFIRMED: {label:<40} type={e.get('change_type','?'):<20} {detail}\n")
        for e in excluded:
            label  = entry_label(e, stage)
            f.write(f"  EXCLUDED:  {label:<40} reason={e.get('reason', e.get('unresolvable_reason','?'))}\n")
        f.write("\n")
```

Then copy to AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR and verify:
```bash
cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_step3_netlist_study_round1.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<TAG>_eco_step3_netlist_study_round1.rpt
```

---

## STEP 4 — Apply ECO to PostEco Netlists

**Spawn a sub-agent (general-purpose)** with the content of `config/eco_agents/eco_applier.md` prepended. Pass:
- `REF_DIR`, `TAG`, `BASE_DIR`, `JIRA`, `ROUND` (current round number — 1 for initial run, 2/3/... for fixer loop), `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`
- The PreEco study JSON from Step 3
- Task: For each confirmed cell, backup PostEco netlist (using `bak_<TAG>_round<ROUND>` naming), locate same cell, verify old_net on pin, replace with new_net (rewire) or auto-insert inverter (new_logic), recompress, verify
- Output: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_applied_round<ROUND>.json`

Wait for eco_applier sub-agent to complete.

**CHECKPOINT:** Verify `data/<TAG>_eco_applied_round<ROUND>.json` exists and contains a `summary` field. Check that backup files `<REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/<Stage>.v.gz.bak_<TAG>_round<ROUND>` exist for each stage that had confirmed cells. Do NOT continue to Step 5 (Pre-FM Quality Checker) if file is missing.

**Generate Step 4 RPT from JSON (ORCHESTRATOR responsibility — NOT eco_applier):**

The RPT must be human-readable and self-explanatory — every entry shows WHY it has that status. Do NOT produce one-liners with no context.

```python
applied = load("data/<TAG>_eco_applied_round<ROUND>.json")
s = applied["summary"]
with open("data/<TAG>_eco_step4_eco_applied_round<ROUND>.rpt", "w") as f:
    f.write(f"STEP 4 — ECO APPLIED (Round <ROUND>)\nTag: <TAG>  |  JIRA: <JIRA>\n{'='*80}\n")
    f.write(f"Summary: {s['applied']} applied / {s['inserted']} inserted / "
            f"{s.get('already_applied', 0)} already_applied / "
            f"{s['skipped']} skipped / {s['verify_failed']} verify_failed\n\n")
    for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
        f.write(f"[{stage}]\n")
        for e in applied[stage]:
            ct = e.get('change_type', '?')
            status = e['status']
            # Build display name from whatever identifier exists
            name = (e.get('instance_name') or e.get('cell_name') or
                    e.get('signal_name') or e.get('port_name') or '?')
            f.write(f"  {status:15s} {name:40s} type={ct}\n")
            # Detail line — always shown, content varies by change_type and status
            if status == 'INSERTED':
                f.write(f"    → cell_type={e.get('cell_type','?')}  output={e.get('output_net','?')}  scope={e.get('instance_scope','?')}\n")
                if e.get('reason'):
                    f.write(f"    → {e['reason']}\n")
            elif status == 'APPLIED':
                if e.get('reason'):
                    f.write(f"    → {e['reason']}\n")
                elif ct == 'rewire':
                    f.write(f"    → {e.get('old_net','?')} → {e.get('new_net','?')} on pin {e.get('pin','?')}\n")
                elif ct in ('port_declaration', 'port_promotion'):
                    f.write(f"    → module={e.get('module_name','?')}  decl_type={e.get('declaration_type','?')}\n")
                elif ct == 'port_connection':
                    f.write(f"    → .{e.get('port_name','?')}({e.get('net_name','?')}) on instance {e.get('instance_name','?')}\n")
            elif status == 'ALREADY_APPLIED':
                ar = e.get('already_applied_reason', e.get('reason', 'no reason recorded — eco_applier must provide already_applied_reason'))
                f.write(f"    → {ar}\n")
            elif status == 'SKIPPED':
                f.write(f"    → REASON: {e.get('reason', 'no reason recorded')}\n")
            elif status == 'VERIFY_FAILED':
                f.write(f"    → VERIFY FAILED: {e.get('reason', 'no reason recorded')}\n")
        f.write("\n")
```

Copy to AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR and verify:
```bash
cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_step4_eco_applied_round<ROUND>.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<TAG>_eco_step4_eco_applied_round<ROUND>.rpt
```

---


---

## STEP 5 — Pre-FM Quality Checker (MANDATORY)

**Spawn a sub-agent (general-purpose)** with `config/eco_agents/eco_pre_fm_checker.md` prepended. Pass:
- `TAG`, `REF_DIR`, `BASE_DIR`, `ROUND=1`, `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`
- Path to applied JSON: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_applied_round1.json`

Wait for sub-agent to complete.

**Read result — gate FM submission:**

**MANDATORY JSON SCHEMA VALIDATION** — verify the eco_pre_fm_checker followed the output contract:
```python
check = load(f"data/{TAG}_eco_pre_fm_check_round1.json")

# Validate required fields — if any missing, eco_pre_fm_checker did not follow the schema
required = ["tag", "round", "passed", "attempts", "issues_found", "issues_fixed",
            "issues_unresolved", "warnings", "check_summary"]
missing = [f for f in required if f not in check]
if missing:
    raise RuntimeError(f"eco_pre_fm_checker JSON missing required fields: {missing}. "
                       f"Re-spawn eco_pre_fm_checker to produce a conformant JSON.")

# Validate check_summary has check8_verilog_validator
if "check8_verilog_validator" not in check.get("check_summary", {}):
    raise RuntimeError("eco_pre_fm_checker JSON missing check_summary.check8_verilog_validator. "
                       "The --strict Verilog validator was not run. Re-spawn eco_pre_fm_checker.")

if check["passed"]:
    # All checks passed (including any inline fixes applied) → proceed to Step 6
    pass
else:
    # Issues remained after MAX_RETRIES inline fix attempts
    # eco_pre_fm_checker exhausted its fix attempts — escalate to ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR
    write_round_handoff({
        "status": "FM_FAILED",
        "eco_fm_tag": "NOT_RUN_PRE_FM_CHECK_FAILED",
        "pre_fm_check_failed": True,
        "pre_fm_check_path": f"data/{TAG}_eco_pre_fm_check_round1.json"
    })
    write_eco_fixer_state(round=1)
    spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR
    HARD STOP  # Step 6 skipped — FM never submitted
```

> **Why before FM:** FM stage-to-stage comparisons (PrePlace vs Synthesize, Route vs PrePlace) fail when stages have different ECO changes applied — e.g., a port added to Synthesize but SKIPPED in PrePlace causes thousands of non-equivalent DFFs. This check takes seconds. FM takes 1-2 hours.

---

## STEP 6 — PostEco Formality Verification

**Spawn a sub-agent (general-purpose)** with the content of `config/eco_agents/eco_fm_runner.md` prepended. Pass:
- `TAG`, `REF_DIR`, `TILE`, `BASE_DIR`, `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR`, `ROUND=1`
- `ECO_TARGETS=FmEqvEcoSynthesizeVsSynRtl FmEqvEcoPrePlaceVsEcoSynthesize FmEqvEcoRouteVsEcoPrePlace`
- Task: write FM config, submit FM, block until complete, parse results, write verify JSON + RPT

Wait for the sub-agent to complete.

**CHECKPOINT:** Verify ALL of the following:
```bash
ls <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_fm_verify.json
ls <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/<TAG>_eco_step6_fm_verify_round1.rpt
```
Also read `data/<TAG>_eco_fm_tag_round1.tmp` to get `eco_fm_tag` — save it to `eco_fixer_state` if FM failed.

---

### Step 6 Notes (reference — do NOT execute yourself)

> **HARD RULE: ORCHESTRATOR runs PostEco FM EXACTLY ONCE — Round 1 only, all 3 targets.**
> If FM fails after Round 1: do NOT re-run FM. Do NOT write a new eco_fm_config. Do NOT call genie_cli again.
> Instead: write round_handoff.json → spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR → HARD STOP.
> Subsequent rounds (Round 2+) are entirely ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR's responsibility. Each ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR instance runs FM exactly once for its round and then spawns the next agent.

Full implementation is in `eco_fm_runner.md`. Key rules for the Round 1 sub-agent: write eco_fm_config with ALL 3 targets (fixed filename, not tag-based), poll every 5 minutes with individual Bash tool calls (max 72 polls = 6h), write tmp file with eco_fm_tag.

### Step 6a — Write FM config file (Round 1 only — all 3 targets)

Write to `<REF_DIR>/data/eco_fm_config` — **fixed filename inside refDir** (NOT tag-based):
```bash
cat > <REF_DIR>/data/eco_fm_config << EOF
ECO_TARGETS=FmEqvEcoSynthesizeVsSynRtl FmEqvEcoPrePlaceVsEcoSynthesize FmEqvEcoRouteVsEcoPrePlace
RUN_SVF_GEN=0
EOF
```

`RUN_SVF_GEN=0` always — SVF generation is disabled. The AI flow never applies SVF.

### Step 6b — Run PostEco FM (once)

```bash
cd <BASE_DIR>
python3 script/genie_cli.py \
  -i "run post eco formality at <REF_DIR> for <TILE>" \
  --execute --xterm
```

The script reads `<REF_DIR>/data/eco_fm_config` automatically.

**[eco_fm_runner sub-agent does this — not the ORCHESTRATOR]** eco_fm_runner reads the tag from CLI output, saves it to `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_fm_tag_round<ROUND>.tmp`, polls `data/<eco_fm_tag>_spec` every 5 minutes until `OVERALL ECO FM RESULT:` appears.

**[eco_fm_runner sub-agent does this — not the ORCHESTRATOR]** eco_fm_runner parses results, merges with previous round's results (carry forward PASS results, update only re-run targets), and writes `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_fm_verify.json`:
```json
{
  "FmEqvEcoSynthesizeVsSynRtl": "PASS",
  "FmEqvEcoPrePlaceVsEcoSynthesize": "PASS",
  "FmEqvEcoRouteVsEcoPrePlace": "PASS",
  "failing_points": [],
  "round": 1,
  "eco_fm_tag": "<eco_fm_tag>"
}
```

**OVERALL PASS** (as determined by the ORCHESTRATOR after the sub-agent completes) = all 3 targets show PASS in the merged `eco_fm_verify.json`.

**[eco_fm_runner sub-agent does this — not the ORCHESTRATOR]** eco_fm_runner writes `data/<TAG>_eco_step6_fm_verify_round1.rpt` and copies it to `AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR/`.

**CHECKPOINT:** Verify both `data/<TAG>_eco_fm_verify.json` and `data/<TAG>_eco_step6_fm_verify_round<ROUND>.rpt` exist and are non-empty.

> **CONTEXT PRESSURE WARNING:** After eco_fm_runner completes, your context window may be near its limit. The ONLY remaining actions are: write round_handoff.json → write eco_fixer_state (if FAIL) → spawn next agent → HARD STOP. Make NO other tool calls. Do NOT read any extra files. Do NOT summarize. Do NOT generate reports. The SPAWN must happen — it is your only remaining mandatory action. If you run out of context without spawning, the RESUMPTION CHECK at the top of this file will recover the flow on the next invocation.

## After Step 6 — Spawn Next Agent

> **ANTI-PATTERN WARNING — READ FIRST:**
> Your ONLY job here is: (A) write `round_handoff.json`, (B) spawn the correct next agent, (C) stop.
> Do NOT run Steps 7 or 8. Do NOT generate reports. Do NOT send emails. Do NOT write `eco_summary.rpt` or `eco_report.html`.
> Those files are FINAL_ORCHESTRATOR's responsibility. If you produce them yourself, you are violating the spawn-then-exit contract and breaking the multi-agent handoff chain.
> **The presence of `eco_report.html` written by THIS agent is a bug, not a success.**

### Mandatory Step A — Write round_handoff.json FIRST

Write `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_round_handoff.json` **before any spawn decision**:

```json
{
  "tag": "<TAG>",
  "ref_dir": "<REF_DIR>",
  "tile": "<TILE>",
  "jira": "<JIRA>",
  "base_dir": "<BASE_DIR>",
  "ai_eco_flow_dir": "<REF_DIR>/AI_ECO_FLOW_<TAG>",
  "round": 1,
  "fenets_tag": "<fenets_tag>",
  "eco_fm_tag": "<eco_fm_tag>",
  "status": "<FM_PASSED|FM_FAILED>"
}
```

**CHECKPOINT — MANDATORY:** Verify `data/<TAG>_round_handoff.json` exists on disk and is non-empty before proceeding:
```bash
ls -la <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_round_handoff.json
```
If the file does not exist or is empty — write it again. Do NOT proceed to spawn until this file is confirmed on disk.

### Mandatory Step B — Spawn the correct next agent

#### If pre_fm_check_failed = true (Step 5 failure — FM was never submitted)

This path is triggered when eco_pre_fm_checker returned `passed: false` after MAX_RETRIES inline fix attempts. FM was **never submitted** this round. The round_handoff.json already has `status: FM_FAILED` and `pre_fm_check_failed: true` from Step 5.

**Spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR** — same as FM FAIL path below. ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR's Step 0 will detect `pre_fm_check_failed: true` in the handoff and skip FM log parsing, reading instead from `eco_pre_fm_check_round<ROUND>.json` for the diagnosis.

#### If FM RESULT = PASS → Spawn FINAL_ORCHESTRATOR

**Spawn FINAL_ORCHESTRATOR agent** with content of `config/eco_agents/FINAL_ORCHESTRATOR.md` prepended. Pass:
- `TAG`, `REF_DIR`, `TILE`, `JIRA`, `BASE_DIR`
- `ROUND_HANDOFF_PATH`: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_round_handoff.json`
- `TOTAL_ROUNDS`: 1

#### If FM RESULT = FAIL or ABORT → Spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR

> **CRITICAL: ABORT is treated IDENTICALLY to FAIL here.** When eco_fm_runner returns with any non-PASS result — whether FM ran comparison (FAIL) or crashed before comparison (ABORT with N/A) — the action is the same: write fixer_state, write round_handoff, spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR, HARD STOP.
>
> Do NOT attempt to diagnose the ABORT. Do NOT re-apply ECO. Do NOT re-submit FM. Do NOT try to fix the netlist yourself. ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR's eco_fm_analyzer will diagnose the abort type (ABORT_NETLIST, ABORT_LINK, etc.) and produce the correct fix.
>
> The difference between FAIL and ABORT only matters to eco_fm_analyzer (Step 0). To ORCHESTRATOR's spawn decision, both are the same: → ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR.

Initialize and write `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_fixer_state`:
```json
{
  "round": 1,
  "tag": "<TAG>",
  "tile": "<TILE>",
  "ref_dir": "<REF_DIR>",
  "jira": "<JIRA>",
  "base_dir": "<BASE_DIR>",
  "ai_eco_flow_dir": "<REF_DIR>/AI_ECO_FLOW_<TAG>",
  "max_rounds": 6,
  "strategies_tried": [],
  "fm_results_per_round": [
    {
      "round": 1,
      "eco_fm_tag": "<eco_fm_tag>",
      "failing_targets": ["<list of failing targets>"],
      "failing_count": {"<target>": "<N>"}
    }
  ]
}
```

**Spawn ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR agent** with content of `config/eco_agents/ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR.md` prepended. Pass:
- `TAG`, `REF_DIR`, `TILE`, `JIRA`, `BASE_DIR`
- `ROUND_HANDOFF_PATH`: `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_round_handoff.json`

### Mandatory Step C — HARD STOP

**Your task ends here. Make no further tool calls. Return your status to the caller.**

You MUST stop after spawning. Do not:
- Run any bash commands after the spawn
- Write any more files
- Read any more files
- Generate any reports or emails
- "Help" FINAL_ORCHESTRATOR or ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR by doing their work early

The next agent has its own fresh context and instructions. Trust the handoff.
