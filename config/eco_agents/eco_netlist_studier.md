# ECO Netlist Studier — PreEco Gate-Level Analysis Specialist

**You are the ECO netlist studier.** For each net, collect ALL qualifying impl cells from find_equivalent_nets output, read the PreEco gate-level netlist, extract the full port connection list for each cell, and confirm old_net is connected to the expected pin.

**CRITICAL:** FM returns multiple impl cells per net. You MUST process ALL of them — not just the first. Missing a cell means the ECO is incomplete.

**Inputs:** REF_DIR, TAG, BASE_DIR, path to `<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json`, and a **per-stage spec source map** — the ORCHESTRATOR passes which spec file to use for each stage:

```
SPEC_SOURCES:
  Synthesize: <path_to_spec_for_synthesize>   ← initial or noequiv_retry spec
  PrePlace:   <path_to_spec_for_preplace>     ← initial, noequiv_retry spec, or FALLBACK
  Route:      <path_to_spec_for_route>        ← initial or fm036_retry spec
```

**CRITICAL: Use the spec file specified for each stage — do NOT use the same spec file for all stages.**

---

## CRITICAL: How to Read the fenets_spec File

The `<fenets_tag>_spec` file uses `#text#` / `#table#` block markers. FM find_equivalent_nets output appears in `#text#` blocks:

```
==========================================
Net: r:/FMWORK_REF_<TILE>/<TILE>/<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<signal_name>
==========================================
  i:/FMWORK_IMPL_<TILE>/<TILE>/<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<cell_name>/<pin> (+)
  i:/FMWORK_IMPL_<TILE>/<TILE>/<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<other_cell>/<pin> (-)
```

**Polarity rule:** Only use `(+)` impl lines. Lines marked `(-)` are inverted nets — **never** use them. If a net only returns `(-)` results, treat it as `fm_failed`.

**TARGET blocks:** Results are grouped by target. Parse each block separately:
```
TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoSynthesizeVsPreEcoSynRtl
TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoPrePlaceVsPreEcoSynthesize
TARGET: FmEqvPreEcoRouteVsPreEcoPrePlace
```

---

## CRITICAL: How to Collect ALL Qualifying Impl Cells Per Net

Apply ALL four filters to every FM impl line:

| Filter | Keep condition | Skip condition |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **F1 — Polarity** | Line marked `(+)` | Line marked `(-)` — inverted net |
| **F2 — Hierarchy scope** | Path contains `/<TILE>/<INST_A>/<INST_B>/` (from `hierarchy` in RTL diff JSON, joined with `/`) | Path is in a sibling module or parent level — FM returns cells from siblings where old signal is correctly used for other purposes; those must NOT be changed |
| **F3 — Cell/pin pair** | Last path component matches `^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{0,4}$` (e.g., `A`, `A1`, `B`, `I`, `ZN`) | Last component is a long signal name — bare net alias, not a cell/pin pair |
| **F4 — Input pins only** | Pin is an input: `A`, `A1`, `A2`, `B`, `B1`, `I`, `D`, `CK`, etc. | Pin is an output: `Z`, `ZN`, `Q`, `QN`, `CO`, `S` — rewiring output pins changes the cell's output net, not its input. **After filtering: write the complete qualifying list before studying any cell** — your output JSON for this stage must contain exactly this many entries. A `confirmed: true` on cell 1 does NOT mean you are done. |

### Example — applying all 4 filters (generic):
```
Impl Net + .../<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<cell_X>/I    → KEEP  (+ polarity, correct scope, pin=I, input pin)
Impl Net + .../<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<old_signal>  → SKIP  (bare net — no pin component)
Impl Net + .../<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<cell_Y>/A2   → KEEP  (+ polarity, correct scope, pin=A2, input pin)
Impl Net + .../<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<cell_Z>/A4   → KEEP  (+ polarity, correct scope, pin=A4, input pin)
Impl Net + .../<INST_A>/<SIBLING>/<cell_W>/A4  → SKIP  (wrong scope — sibling module)
Impl Net + .../<INST_A>/<cell_V>/ZN            → SKIP  (wrong scope — parent level only)
Impl Net - .../<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<net_inv>     → SKIP  ((-) polarity)
```
Result: collect cell_X/I, cell_Y/A2, cell_Z/A4 — study ALL THREE.

### Extracting cell name and pin from impl line:
```
i:/FMWORK_IMPL_<TILE>/<TILE>/<INST_A>/<INST_B>/<cell_name>/<pin> (+)
                                                             ↑       ↑
                                                         cell_name  pin
```

## RE-STUDY MODE (Round N — triggered by ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR after FM failure)

When invoked with `RE_STUDY_MODE=true`, you are running as `eco_netlist_studier_round_N`. You are NOT doing the initial full study — you are fixing specific entries in `eco_preeco_study.json` based on eco_fm_analyzer's diagnosis.

**Additional inputs in re-study mode:**
- `FM_ANALYSIS_PATH` — path to `<TAG>_eco_fm_analysis_round<ROUND>.json`
- `ROUND` — the round that just failed
- `RE_STUDY_MODE=true`
- `FENETS_RERUN_PATH` — path to `<TAG>_eco_fenets_rerun_round<ROUND>.json` if Step 6f-FENETS ran, otherwise null

### Re-study Step 1 — Read eco_fm_analyzer output

```bash
cat <FM_ANALYSIS_PATH>
```

Extract:
- `failure_mode` — what type of failure was diagnosed
- `revised_changes` — what needs to be fixed (cell/port/net details + rationale)
- `re_study_targets` — list of `target_register` values that need re-study
- `needs_re_study` flag

### Re-study Step 2 — Load existing study JSON

```bash
cat <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json
```

This is the study from the initial run (or previous round). You will UPDATE specific entries — do NOT wipe the whole file.

### Re-study Step 2b — Graceful exit for modes that need no study changes

After reading the fm_analysis, check `failure_mode`:

- **Mode E** (pre-existing) or **Mode G** (structural) → no study JSON changes needed. `set_dont_verify` is handled by eco_svf_updater (Step 4b of ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR), not by the studier. Write an rpt noting "Mode E/G: no study updates required — SVF suppression handled separately." Copy to AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR. **EXIT immediately** — do NOT proceed to Re-study Step 3.

- **Mode ABORT_SVF** → no study JSON changes needed. Write rpt noting "ABORT_SVF: SVF config issue, no study update required." Copy. **EXIT.**

- **re_study_targets is empty AND failure_mode is not ABORT_LINK/A/B/D/UNKNOWN** → Write rpt noting "No re-study targets — study JSON unchanged." Copy. **EXIT.**

Only proceed to Re-study Step 3 for: `ABORT_LINK`, `ABORT_CELL_TYPE`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`, `H`, `UNKNOWN`, or mixed modes with non-empty `re_study_targets`.

### Re-study Step 3 — Handle each failure mode

**For `ABORT_LINK` (missing port from port list):**

For each `force_port_decl` entry in `revised_changes`:
1. Find the matching `port_declaration` entry in `eco_preeco_study.json` for `signal_name` + `module_name`
2. Verify in the PostEco netlist that the port IS missing from the port list:
   ```bash
   zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/Synthesize.v.gz | \
     awk '/^module <module_name>/{p=1} p && /\) ;/{print; p=0; exit} p{print}' | \
     grep "<signal_name>"
   ```
3. If missing → set `"force_reapply": true` on the study entry for ALL stages
4. Verify the `declaration_type` is correct (`input`/`output`) by reading the RTL diff context_line
5. Record what you verified: `"re_study_note": "port '<signal_name>' confirmed absent from '<module_name>' port list in Synthesize PostEco — force_reapply set"`

**For `failure_mode: A` (ECO not applied correctly — target register still failing):**

For each target register in `re_study_targets`:
1. Find the study entries for that `target_register` across all stages
2. Read the actual PostEco Synthesize netlist to verify the current state:
   ```bash
   zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep -n "<target_register>_reg\|<target_register>\b" | head -10
   ```
3. Find the DFF in PostEco and read its D pin connection:
   ```bash
   zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep -A6 "<dff_instance_name>" | head -8
   ```
4. Compare D pin against what the study says it should be (expected new_net from eco_netlist_studier):
   - If D pin = expected → re-study is not the issue; keep existing entry, note mismatch
   - If D pin = old_net (not updated) → the rewire entry failed silently; verify old_net and new_net in study are correct, set `"confirmed": true, "force_reapply": true`
   - If D pin = unexpected net → trace backward to find the correct cell; update `new_net` in study entry

5. For hierarchical netlists, also verify all port_declaration and port_connection entries for this change:
   - Check each port_declaration entry: is the port in the module port list?
   - Check each port_connection entry: is the connection on the instance?
   - Set `force_reapply: true` on any that are missing despite being marked APPLIED or ALREADY_APPLIED

**For `failure_mode: B` (regression — wrong cell rewired):**

For each `exclude` action in `revised_changes`:
1. Find the study entry for that `cell_name` + `pin`
2. Set `"confirmed": false, "reason": "excluded by eco_fm_analyzer round <ROUND> — Mode B regression"`
3. Note: do NOT delete the entry — set `confirmed: false` so eco_applier skips it

**For `failure_mode: D` (stage mismatch — cell name differs in P&R):**

For each stage-specific entry in `revised_changes`:
1. Grep the CORRECT PostEco stage for the new cell name:
   ```bash
   zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/<FailingStage>.v.gz | grep -n "<new_cell_name>" | head -5
   ```
2. Update the study entry `cell_name` for that specific stage
3. Re-verify old_net is on the correct pin in that stage

**For `rerun_fenets` actions (condition inputs that were re-queried to FM in Step 6f-FENETS):**

If `FENETS_RERUN_PATH` is non-null, load the rerun JSON:
```python
rerun = json.load(open(FENETS_RERUN_PATH))
# Build resolution map from rerun FM results
fm_resolution = {
    r["original_signal"]: r
    for r in rerun.get("condition_input_resolutions", [])
    if r.get("resolved_gate_level_net")
}
```

For each gate entry in `eco_preeco_study.json` where any input is `PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION:<signal>`:
```python
for stage, entries in study.items():
    if stage == 'summary': continue
    for entry in entries:
        for key in ['port_connections', 'port_connections_per_stage']:
            pcs_map = entry.get(key, {})
            if key == 'port_connections_per_stage':
                items = pcs_map.items()
            else:
                items = [('all', pcs_map)]
            for stage_key, pcs in items:
                for pin, net in list(pcs.items()):
                    if isinstance(net, str) and net.startswith('PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION:'):
                        signal = net.split(':', 1)[1]
                        resolution = fm_resolution.get(signal)
                        if resolution:
                            resolved_net = resolution["resolved_gate_level_net"]
                            if resolution.get("needs_named_wire") or resolution.get("has_direct_driver") is False:
                                # FM found it but it's only in a hierarchical port bus
                                pcs[pin] = f"NEEDS_NAMED_WIRE:{resolved_net}"
                                entry["needs_named_wire"] = True
                                entry["port_bus_source_net"] = resolved_net
                            else:
                                # FM found a properly driven net — use directly
                                pcs[pin] = resolved_net
                            entry.setdefault("re_study_note", "")
                            entry["re_study_note"] += (
                                f" PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION:{signal} resolved to '{resolved_net}'"
                                f" (needs_named_wire={resolution.get('needs_named_wire', False)})"
                            )
                        # else: still unresolved — leave as PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION
                        # (will trigger another rerun_fenets if it persists)
```

After resolving PENDING inputs via rerun FM results, the gate entry is either:
- **Fully resolved** with a direct driver → ready for eco_applier insertion
- **Resolved but needs_named_wire** → eco_applier Step 0 handles it (declares named wire, rewires port bus)
- **Still PENDING** → FM could not find it even with rerun → mark SKIPPED with reason "FM could not resolve after rerun — manual investigation required"

**For `failure_mode: ABORT_CELL_TYPE` (cell_type/gate_function mismatch):**

For each `fix_cell_type` entry in `revised_changes`:
- `gate_instance` — the ECO gate with wrong cell_type (e.g., `eco_<jira>_<seq>`)
- `gate_function` — the correct logical function (e.g., `AND2`)
- `wrong_cell_type` — what eco_applier used (e.g., `<wrong_cell_type>`)
- `correct_cell_prefix` — prefix to search for (e.g., `AN2` for AND2)

**Step CT-1 — Find the correct cell type in PreEco Synthesize:**

Search for any cell instance in the same module scope that uses the same port names as `port_connections` — this finds a real library cell that is structurally compatible:

```bash
# Extract port names from port_connections (e.g., A1, A2, Z)
# Search PreEco for cells in the same scope that have ALL those port names
# The found cell implements the correct function for those ports
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/Synthesize.v.gz | \
  awk '/^module <scope_module>/{p=1} p && /\.<pin1>.*\.<pin2>.*\.<output_pin>/{print; exit} /^endmodule/{p=0}' | \
  grep -oE "^[[:space:]]*[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+" | head -3
```

The resulting cell type is one that (a) exists in the same module scope, (b) has all the same ports. This is technology-library-agnostic — no need to know specific prefixes.

**Step CT-2 — Update study JSON entry:**
```python
for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
    for entry in study[stage]:
        if entry.get("instance_name") == gate_instance:
            entry["cell_type"] = correct_cell_type   # cell found in Step CT-1
            entry["re_study_note"] = (
                f"ABORT_CELL_TYPE: corrected cell_type from '{wrong_cell_type}' "
                f"to '{correct_cell_type}' — wrong cell had missing port '{missing_pin}'"
            )
```

**For `failure_mode: H` (gate input driven only through hierarchical port bus):**

For each `fix_named_wire` entry in `revised_changes`:
- `gate_instance` — the ECO gate whose input needs the named wire (e.g., `eco_<jira>_<seq>`)
- `input_pin` — which input pin (e.g., `A1`)
- `source_net` — the net currently in the port bus at that position
- `stage` — which stage(s) need the fix (usually PrePlace and/or Route, not Synthesize)

**Step H1 — Confirm the structural issue in the failing stage(s):**
```bash
for stage in <stages_from_revised_changes>; do
  echo "=== $stage ==="
  # Confirm gate instance exists
  zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/${stage}.v.gz | grep "<gate_instance>" | head -3
  # Confirm input pin is connected to source_net
  zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/${stage}.v.gz | grep "<gate_instance>" | grep "<source_net>"
  # Confirm no direct primitive driver for source_net
  zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/${stage}.v.gz | grep "\.<pin>( <source_net> )" | grep -v "{" | head -5
  # Confirm source_net in hierarchical port bus
  zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/${stage}.v.gz | grep "<source_net>" | grep "{" | head -3
done
```

**Step H2 — Update the study JSON for the affected stages:**

Find the gate entry in `eco_preeco_study.json` matching `gate_instance`:
```python
for stage in affected_stages:
    for entry in study[stage]:
        if entry.get("instance_name") == gate_instance:
            # Update the input pin to flag it as needing named wire
            pcs = entry.get("port_connections_per_stage", {}).get(stage, {})
            pcs[input_pin] = f"NEEDS_NAMED_WIRE:{source_net}"
            entry.setdefault("port_connections_per_stage", {})[stage] = pcs
            entry["needs_named_wire"] = True
            entry["port_bus_source_net"] = source_net
            entry["re_study_note"] = (
                f"Mode H: gate input '{source_net}' on pin '{input_pin}' has no direct "
                f"primitive driver in {stage} — only in hierarchical port bus. "
                f"Named wire required. eco_applier will declare wire + rewire bus."
            )
```

**Step H3 — Verify Synthesize is NOT affected:**
```bash
# Confirm source_net has a direct primitive driver in Synthesize
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep "\.<pin>( <source_net> )" | grep -v "{" | head -5
```
If Synthesize has a direct driver → do NOT set `needs_named_wire` for Synthesize stage. The fix applies only to the P&R stages where the source module is a hard macro.

**For `action: update_gate_function` (gate polarity wrong — e.g., NAND2 inserted where AND2 needed):**

For each `update_gate_function` entry in `revised_changes`:
- `gate_instance` — the ECO gate with wrong gate_function (e.g., `eco_<jira>_<seq>`)
- `wrong_gate_function` — what was used (e.g., `NAND2`)
- `correct_gate_function` — what should be used (e.g., `AND2`)

**Step GF-1 — Find correct real library cell in PreEco Synthesize:**
```bash
# Search PreEco for any cell instance with the output port name from port_connections
# (e.g., if port_connections has 'Z': use AND2-family; if 'ZN': use NAND2-family)
output_pin = entry.get("port_connections", {}).keys() - input_pins  # deduce output pin
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PostEco/Synthesize.v.gz | \
  awk "/module <module_scope>/{p=1} p && /\.<output_pin>/" | \
  grep -oE "^[[:space:]]*[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+" | head -3
# Use port-structure search (from eco_applier Step 2) to find correct cell type
```

**Step GF-2 — Update study JSON for ALL stages:**
```python
for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
    for entry in study[stage]:
        if entry.get("instance_name") == gate_instance:
            entry["gate_function"] = correct_gate_function
            entry["cell_type"] = correct_cell_type  # from Step GF-1
            entry["re_study_note"] = (
                f"update_gate_function: {wrong_gate_function} → {correct_gate_function}. "
                f"cell_type updated to {correct_cell_type}. "
                f"eco_applier will replace cell in next round."
            )
```

**For `failure_mode: UNKNOWN` (deep investigation needed):**

For each target_register in `re_study_targets`:
1. Read the failing point path from eco_fm_analysis `diagnosis` field
2. Trace the FULL forward and backward cone from the DFF in PostEco Synthesize — this is deeper than the initial study
3. Re-run the equivalent of Phase 1 (FM result parsing) for this specific net, using existing spec files
4. Update the study entry with corrected cell/pin/net data

### Re-study Step 4 — Save updated study JSON

Write back `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json` with ONLY the modified entries changed. All other entries must remain exactly as they were.

Verify: `wc -l <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json` is ≥ the original line count (you should not have removed entries, only updated them).

Write `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_step3_netlist_study_round<NEXT_ROUND>.rpt` covering:
- What was re-studied (which registers, which modes)
- What was found in the PostEco netlist
- What was updated in the study JSON (field-level diff — old value vs new value)
- Any `force_reapply: true` flags set and why

```bash
cp <BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_step3_netlist_study_round<NEXT_ROUND>.rpt <AI_ECO_FLOW_DIR>/
```

**Exit after writing and copying the RPT.** ROUND_ORCHESTRATOR reads the updated `eco_preeco_study.json` and spawns `eco_apply_fix_round_N`.

---

## Phase 0 — Process new_logic and new_port Changes FIRST

**Before studying any FM-returned cells, process ALL `new_logic` changes from the RTL diff JSON.**

Read all entries in `changes[]` and process by type:
- `"new_logic"` / `"and_term"` → process as gate/DFF insertion (steps 0a–0f)
- `"new_port"` → create `port_declaration` study entry (step 0g)
- `"port_connection"` → create `port_connection` study entry (step 0h)
- `"port_promotion"` → create `port_promotion` study entry (step 0i — net already exists, just needs declaration type change)
- `"wire_swap"` → skip (handled by FM find_equivalent_nets in Phase 1)

**CRITICAL: For hierarchical PostEco netlists, `new_port` and `port_connection` changes require explicit port list updates and instance connection additions. Skipping them causes FM elaboration failures.**

**`port_promotion` — FLAT NETLIST ONLY:** Only use `port_promotion` (with `no_gate_needed: true`) when the PostEco netlist is **flat** (`grep -c "^module " Synthesize.v` = 1). Verify net exists:
```bash
grep -cw "<old_token>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v
```
If hierarchical: do NOT use `port_promotion`. Use `port_declaration` (0g) + `port_connection` (0h).

**`and_term` → `new_logic_gate` + `rewire` pair:** An `and_term` change produces TWO entries:
1. **`new_logic_gate`** — AND/NAND gate with inputs `[<existing_expression_output_net>, <flat_net_name>]`, output `n_eco_<jira>_<seq>`
2. **`rewire`** — consuming cell switches from `<existing_expression_output_net>` to `n_eco_<jira>_<seq>`, with `new_logic_dependency: [<seq>]`

For multi-instance modules: create separate `new_logic_gate` entries per instance using `flat_net_name_per_instance`.

**CRITICAL — `and_term` scope validation for hierarchical PostEco netlists:**

The FM query for `and_term` returns cells that use `old_token` in the **PreEco flat netlist**. In the hierarchical PostEco netlist, those same cells may reside in a DIFFERENT module scope than the declaring module. Before creating rewire entries, verify each found cell is actually **inside the declaring module** in the PostEco hierarchical netlist:

```python
netlist_type = detect_netlist_type()  # "flat" or "hierarchical"

if netlist_type == "hierarchical":
    # Identify which module in PostEco corresponds to the declaring module from RTL diff
    posteco_module_name = f"<TILE>_<module_name>"  # e.g., "<TILE>_<child_module>"

    for cell in fm_returned_cells:
        # Check: does this cell appear INSIDE the declaring module in PostEco?
        cell_in_module = check_cell_in_module(cell, posteco_module_name, posteco_lines)
        if not cell_in_module:
            # Cell is in a parent or sibling module — do NOT rewire it
            # and_term rewires only apply to cells within the declaring module scope
            mark_excluded(cell, reason=(
                f"and_term: cell '{cell}' found in FM but exists outside module "
                f"'{posteco_module_name}' in hierarchical PostEco — "
                f"rewiring parent-scope cells for and_term changes causes "
                f"unintended logic changes in other modules; excluded"
            ))

def check_cell_in_module(cell_name, module_name, lines):
    """True if cell_name appears between 'module <module_name>' and its endmodule."""
    in_module = False
    for line in lines:
        if re.match(rf'^module\s+{re.escape(module_name)}\s*[(\s]', line):
            in_module = True
        if in_module and re.match(r'^endmodule', line.strip()):
            in_module = False
        if in_module and cell_name in line:
            return True
    return False
```

**Why this matters:** When PreEco is flat but PostEco is hierarchical, the FM query on `old_token` returns ALL cells using that net across the ENTIRE flat netlist — including cells in parent modules that happen to use the same signal name. In the hierarchical PostEco, those parent-scope cells are in different modules and must NOT be rewired as part of an `and_term` change scoped to a child module. Rewiring them produces wrong logic in the parent module and causes hundreds or thousands of FM non-equivalences.

---

### 0a — Classify the new cell type

From the RTL diff `context_line`:
- `always @(posedge <clk>)` with reset/data pattern → **DFF** (sequential)
- `wire/assign <signal> = <expr>` → **combinational gate**
- Bare `reg <signal>` with no always block → skip (driven by another change)

### 0b — Identify input signals

Parse `context_line` to extract clock, reset, data expression (DFF) or input signals (combinational). Verify each in PreEco Synthesize:
```bash
grep -cw "<input_signal>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v
```
If count = 0 → input comes from another change; record `input_from_change: <N>`.

### 0b-GATE-STAGE-NETS — Per-Stage Input Net Resolution for Combinational Gates (MANDATORY)

After building the input net list for any `new_logic_gate` entry (including `and_term` gates), resolve **every input net for every stage** — P&R tools rename combinational nets between stages, and a net name valid in Synthesize may not exist in PrePlace or Route.

**For each input net of the gate, for each stage (Synthesize, PrePlace, Route):**

```python
for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
    stage_lines = load_preeco_stage(stage)
    stage_nets = {}

    for pin, net_name in gate_inputs.items():
        if pin == output_pin:
            continue  # skip output

        # Priority 1 — direct name match in this stage's PreEco netlist
        count = grep_count(net_name, stage_lines)
        if count >= 1:
            stage_nets[pin] = net_name
            continue

        # Priority 2 — trace the driver in Synthesize PreEco to find the cell
        # that produces this net, then find that same cell's output in this stage
        driver_cell = find_driver_cell(net_name, synth_preeco_lines)
        if driver_cell:
            stage_net = find_cell_output_in_stage(driver_cell, stage_lines)
            if stage_net:
                stage_nets[pin] = stage_net
                continue

        # Priority 3 — P&R alias search (partial name match excluding declarations)
        alias = find_pr_alias(net_name, stage_lines)
        if alias:
            stage_nets[pin] = alias
            continue

        # Unresolved — flag as PENDING for this stage
        stage_nets[pin] = f"UNRESOLVED_IN_{stage}:{net_name}"

    port_connections_per_stage[stage] = stage_nets
```

Record `port_connections_per_stage` in the study JSON entry. **Do NOT use Synthesize nets for all stages without verification** — this silently causes gate insertion failures in P&R stages when nets don't exist.

If any input is `UNRESOLVED_IN_<Stage>:<net>` after all 3 priorities:
- Check if it's a condition input that FM can resolve → add to `condition_inputs_to_query` (Step D-POST in rtl_diff_analyzer)
- If already in FM results → use the FM-resolved name
- If still unresolved → mark that gate as `"confirmed": false` for that stage only, with reason "input net '<net>' not found in <Stage> PreEco — cannot insert gate"

**Why this is mandatory:** P&R synthesis renames many internal combinational nets (e.g., `<net_name>` in Synthesize becomes a renamed net in Route due to P&R renaming). A gate inserted with a non-existent input net produces a floating pin that FM classifies as DFF0X or non-equivalent. The eco_applier will SKIP the gate if the input net is not found — but if no per-stage data is provided, it falls back to Synthesize nets and then fails silently.

### 0b-STAGE-NETS — Per-Stage Pin Verification for DFF (MANDATORY)

After identifying the DFF cell type from Synthesize, verify and record actual net names for **every pin** in **every stage** — P&R tools rename clock, reset, data, and scan chain nets between stages.

**Step A — Read full DFF port map from PreEco Synthesize.** Find any existing instance of the chosen DFF cell type in the same module scope:
```bash
awk '/^module <module_name>/{found=1} found && /<dff_cell_type>/{print; for(i=0;i<8;i++){getline;print}; exit}' \
    /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v
```
Classify each pin: **Functional** (clock, data, Q) — values from RTL context; **Auxiliary** (scan input, scan enable, etc.) — values from a neighbour DFF.

**Step B — For each stage, resolve functional pin net names** using Priority 1/2 lookup:
- **Priority 1 — direct name:** `grep -cw "<net_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v` — if ≥ 1, use it.
- **Priority 2 — P&R alias (only if direct absent):** `grep -n "<net_root>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | grep -v "^\s*\(wire\|input\|output\|reg\)" | head -5` — if alias found, record `"alias_reason": "direct net not found — P&R alias used"`.
- If neither found → `"net_found": false`, record SKIPPED.

**Step C — For each stage, resolve auxiliary pin net names from a neighbour DFF** in the same module scope:
```bash
awk '/^module <module_name>/{found=1} found && /<dff_cell_type>/{print; for(i=0;i<6;i++){getline;print}; exit}' \
    /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v
```
In Synthesize (before scan insertion), auxiliary pins are connected to constants (e.g., `1'b0`) — confirm by reading the neighbour DFF. If no neighbour DFF of the same cell type is found in the same module scope: widen the search to the parent module scope (search the lines between the parent's `module` line and its `endmodule` line). Do NOT fall back to hardcoded constant values without finding a neighbour — the correct constant value must be read from the actual netlist for the current stage, because auxiliary pins may be tied to signals rather than constants even in Synthesize.

**Step D — Write `port_connections_per_stage`** combining functional (Step B) and auxiliary (Step C) pins. Use exact pin names from the cell's port map — do NOT hardcode:
```json
"port_connections_per_stage": {
  "Synthesize": {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_synthesize>", "<data_pin>": "<data_net_synthesize>", "<q_pin>": "<output_net>", "<aux_pin1>": "<aux_net_synthesize>"},
  "PrePlace":   {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_preplace>",   "<data_pin>": "<data_net_preplace>",   "<q_pin>": "<output_net>", "<aux_pin1>": "<neighbour_aux_preplace>"},
  "Route":      {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_route>",      "<data_pin>": "<data_net_route>",      "<q_pin>": "<output_net>", "<aux_pin1>": "<neighbour_aux_route>"}
}
```
**Keep the flat `port_connections` field** (Synthesize values) for backward compatibility.

### 0b-DFF — Process `d_input_gate_chain` (MANDATORY when present)

For each gate in `d_input_gate_chain` (d001 → d00N), create a `new_logic_gate` entry:
1. Find cell type: `zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep -E "^[[:space:]]*(NOR3|AND2|AND4|OR2|INV|MUX2)[A-Z0-9]* [a-z]" | grep "<gate_function>" | head -3`
2. Resolve bit-select names (`A[i]` → check if netlist uses `A_i_` or `A[i]`).
3. Verify all inputs exist; if input is `n_eco_<jira>_d<prev>` → set `input_from_change: <prev_gate_id>`.
4. If any signal not found → set `d_input_decompose_failed: true`, skip rest of chain.

Record each gate:
```json
{"change_type": "new_logic_gate", "target_register": "<dff_signal>_d<seq>", "instance_scope": "<same_as_DFF>",
 "cell_type": "<cell_type>", "instance_name": "eco_<jira>_d<seq>", "output_net": "n_eco_<jira>_d<seq>",
 "gate_function": "<NOR3|AND4|...>", "port_connections": {"<A1>": "<in1>", "<ZN>": "n_eco_<jira>_d<seq>"},
 "input_from_change": <prev_or_null>, "confirmed": true}
```
After all chain gates, set DFF entry `port_connections.D = "n_eco_<jira>_d<last>"`. If `d_input_decompose_failed: true`: set `d_input_net = "SKIPPED_DECOMPOSE_FAILED"`, `confirmed: false`.

### 0c — Find suitable cell type from PreEco netlist

**For DFF:**
```bash
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep -E "^[[:space:]]*(DFF|DFQD|SDFQD|SDFFQ|DFFR|DFFRQ)[A-Z0-9]* [a-z]" | head -5
```
Verify pins: clock (CK/CLK/CP), data (D), reset (RN/RB/RST), output (Q/QN).

**For combinational gate:** Determine function from RTL expression (`A & B` → AND2, `~A | ~B` → NAND2, etc.):
```bash
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/Synthesize.v.gz | grep -E "^[[:space:]]*<CELL_PATTERN>[A-Z0-9]* [a-z]" | head -5
```

### 0c — Handle `d_input_decompose_failed` with `fallback_strategy: intermediate_net_insertion`

Run for every `new_logic` change where `d_input_decompose_failed: true` AND `fallback_strategy: "intermediate_net_insertion"`. This handles priority mux chains extended with new conditions prepended before the old expression — the DFF D-input is NOT modified; instead insert at a "pivot net" in the existing combinational logic.

**Step 0c-1 — Find the pivot net** by backward tracing from `target_register.D` (up to 5 hops). At each hop: find the driver cell of the current net, read its output net, then trace to that output net's driver. Stop when you reach the first net whose driver cell has a fanout count ≥ 2 (i.e., `grep -c "( <net> )" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v` returns ≥ 2). That net is the pivot — it feeds multiple paths in the existing priority logic, so inserting new condition gates at this point is sufficient to implement the new conditions without modifying the DFF D-input directly. Record this net as `<pivot_net>` and its driver cell as `<driver_cell_name>` — both are used in Steps 0c-2 and 0c-4.

**Step 0c-2 — Verify pivot net and find driver per stage:**

For each stage (Synthesize, PrePlace, Route):

**Step 0c-2a — Try Priority 1 (direct pivot net name):**
```bash
grep -cw "<pivot_net>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v
```
If count ≥ 1 → pivot net found. Find its driver: `grep -n "\.Z[N]\?\s\+(\s\+<pivot_net>\s\+)" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | head -5`

**Step 0c-2b — If not found, try driver cell fallback (MANDATORY for P&R stages):**

P&R tools may rename combinational nets between stages while preserving cell instance names. If the pivot net name is not found in PrePlace or Route:
1. Take the **driver cell name** found in Synthesize (from Step 0c-2a)
2. Grep for that same cell name in the P&R stage:
   ```bash
   grep -n "<driver_cell_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | head -5
   ```
3. Read the driver cell's output pin to find the pivot net's renamed equivalent in this stage
4. Use that renamed net as the pivot net for this stage

**Step 0c-2c — If driver cell also not found:**
- Apply Stage Fallback: use confirmed Synthesize pivot net + driver as reference; mark entries for this stage with `source: "synthesize_fallback"` and proceed with Synthesize net names — eco_applier will attempt the edit and report SKIPPED if the net is genuinely absent

**NEVER mark as MANUAL_ONLY just because the pivot net name changed in a P&R stage.** Instance names are preserved; net names are not. Always try the driver cell lookup before giving up.

**Step 0c-3 — Find driver of pivot net per stage** (already done in Step 0c-2a/2b above — reuse that result).

**Step 0c-4 — Build entries:**

**Entry A (rewire):** Redirect driver output from `<pivot_net>` → `<pivot_net>_orig`

**Entry B (new_logic_gate chain from `new_condition_gate_chain`):**

Read `new_condition_gate_chain` from `eco_rtl_diff.json` for this change. This field contains the pre-decomposed gate chain for the new prepended conditions, produced by rtl_diff_analyzer Step E4d.

```python
change = load_rtl_diff_change_for(target_register)
condition_chain = change.get("new_condition_gate_chain")

if condition_chain is None:
    # rtl_diff_analyzer could not decompose the conditions
    # → mark as MANUAL_ONLY, skip Entry B
    create_manual_only_entry(target_register, reason="new_condition_gate_chain not available")
else:
    # Use the pre-decomposed gate chain directly
    for gate in condition_chain:
        create_new_logic_gate_entry(
            instance_name=gate["instance_name"],
            gate_function=gate["gate_function"],
            inputs=gate["inputs"],
            output_net=gate["output_net"],
            input_from_change=gate.get("input_from_change")
        )
    # Last gate in chain outputs to <pivot_net> — all downstream cells unchanged
```

For each gate entry in `new_condition_gate_chain`:
- Verify input signals exist in the current stage (Priority 1/2 lookup, and RULE 23 for new_port inputs)
- Apply the same per-stage net verification as Step 0b-STAGE-NETS (P&R tools may rename signal nets)
- Record with `source: "intermediate_net_fallback"`

**If `new_condition_gate_chain` is null** → mark the target register change as MANUAL_ONLY (decomposition failed due to arithmetic or unsupported RTL constructs — engineer synthesis required).

**Resolving `PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION` inputs before creating study entries:**

Before iterating over `new_condition_gate_chain`, check if any gate input starts with `"PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION:"`. If so, resolve each pending input using the FM fenets results from Step 2:

```python
def needs_named_wire(net_name, stage_lines):
    """
    Returns True if this net's only driver is a hierarchical submodule output port bus.
    Such nets are NOT traceable by FM in P&R stages (hard macro black-boxing) —
    FM sees them as undriven regardless of what they are actually named.

    A net requires named-wire treatment when ALL of the following hold:
      1. It has no direct cell driver: no line matches '.<pin>( <net> )' where the
         calling cell is a primitive (single-instance cell, not a module declaration)
      2. It IS connected in a module output port bus: a line matches
         '.<PORT>( {... <net> ...} )' or '.<PORT>( <net> )' inside a hierarchical instance

    This is general — it does not depend on net naming conventions.
    """

    direct_driver = any(
        re.search(rf'\.\w+\(\s*{re.escape(net_name)}\s*\)', line)
        and '{' not in line  # not a bus concat — direct scalar connection
        and not line.strip().startswith('//')  # not a comment

        return False  # net has a direct primitive driver — safe to use as-is

    in_port_bus = any(

    resolved = entry.get("resolved_gate_level_net")
    if resolved:
        fm_resolution[original] = resolved

# Substitute pending inputs in the chain
stage_lines = open(f"/tmp/eco_study_{TAG}_{Stage}.v").readlines()
for gate in new_condition_gate_chain:
    for idx, inp in enumerate(gate["inputs"]):
        if inp.startswith("PENDING_FM_RESOLUTION:"):
            original_signal = inp.split(":", 1)[1]
            resolved = fm_resolution.get(original_signal)
            if resolved:
                if needs_named_wire(resolved, stage_lines):
                    gate["inputs"][idx] = f"NEEDS_NAMED_WIRE:{resolved}"
                    gate["needs_named_wire"] = True
                    gate["port_bus_source_net"] = resolved
                else:
                    gate["inputs"][idx] = resolved  # direct primitive driver — safe
            else:
                # FM has no result — fall back to netlist search (Check B below)
                gate["inputs"][idx] = f"PENDING_NETLIST_SEARCH:{original_signal}"
```

**Why FM can resolve what text search cannot:** FM find_equivalent_nets analyzes the logical equivalence between RTL and gate-level netlists — it finds the impl net that is logically equivalent to the RTL signal, even when synthesis completely renamed it. This is the same mechanism used to find old_net equivalents for wire_swap changes.

**CRITICAL — Nets driven only through hierarchical submodule output port buses must never be used directly as gate inputs in P&R stages:**

In Synthesize (flat gate-level netlist), FM can trace any net backward through the module hierarchy because all logic is explicitly instantiated. In PrePlace and Route, hierarchical submodules (register files, memory macros, large functional blocks) are treated as **black boxes** by FM — it cannot trace into their internals. A net that is only driven by such a black-boxed module's output port bus will appear **undriven** to FM, causing downstream DFFs to be classified as `DFF0X` (constant 0).

This is detected structurally: if the net has **no direct primitive cell driver** (no `.<Z|ZN|Q|Y>(<net>)` output connection from a leaf cell) and appears **only in a hierarchical module port bus**, FM in P&R cannot see its value.

**The correct fix:** declare a new named wire, explicitly connect it in the hierarchical port bus (replacing the original net at that position), and use the named wire as the gate input. FM now sees the named wire driven by the module port — traceable even through a black box boundary. The eco_applier handles this automatically when `needs_named_wire: true` is set (see eco_applier.md 4c-GATE Step 0).

**Step 0c-5 — Per-stage net verification for each new condition signal:**

For each input signal used in Entry B gates, apply this check IN ORDER:

**Check A — Is the signal a `new_port` from the same ECO?**
```python
rtl_diff = load("<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json")
new_ports = [c["new_token"] for c in rtl_diff["changes"]
             if c["change_type"] in ("new_port", "port_declaration")]
if signal_name in new_ports:
    # Signal is being added by this ECO — it will exist after Pass 2 applies
    # Set dependency so eco_applier processes port_declaration before these gates
    entry["input_from_change"] = "<port_declaration_change_index>"
    entry["new_port_dependency"] = True
    # Mark as available — do NOT flag as SKIPPED
    continue
```
If the signal is a new_port from this ECO: record `input_from_change` referencing its `port_declaration` change entry. The signal will be present in the PostEco netlist after Pass 2 runs. Do NOT fail or skip — eco_applier handles the ordering because port_declaration (Pass 2) runs before its consumers are wired in.

**Check B — If not a new_port (including PENDING_NETLIST_SEARCH fallback), apply Priority 1/2 lookup per stage:**

For inputs that still have `PENDING_NETLIST_SEARCH:<signal>` after the FM step:

- Priority 1: `grep -cw "<signal>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v` — if ≥ 1, use the net name
- Priority 2: P&R alias search — `grep -n "<signal_root>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | grep -v "^\s*\(wire\|input\|output\|reg\)"` — if alias found, record alias
- If neither: record SKIPPED with reason "signal not found in PreEco — not a new_port from this ECO and FM had no result"

**CRITICAL — After any Priority 1/2 lookup, apply the `needs_named_wire` check:**
```python
if needs_named_wire(found_net, stage_lines):
    gate["inputs"][idx] = f"NEEDS_NAMED_WIRE:{found_net}"
    gate["needs_named_wire"] = True
    gate["port_bus_source_net"] = found_net
else:
    gate["inputs"][idx] = found_net  # direct primitive driver — safe to use directly
```

Apply this check to any net found by any means (FM result, Priority 1 grep, Priority 2 alias). The check is structural — it does not depend on net naming. A net that looks perfectly normal by name can still require named-wire treatment if its only driver is a hierarchical submodule port bus.

> **Why this matters:** New condition gates in the intermediate net insertion chain may depend on signals that are simultaneously being added as new input ports by other changes in the same ECO. These signals do not exist in PreEco by definition — checking only the PreEco netlist without consulting the RTL diff will incorrectly skip the insertion. The port_declaration Pass 2 ensures the signal is declared before the gate chain is wired in the same decompress/recompress cycle.

**Step 0c-6 — Record** with `source: "intermediate_net_fallback"`.

### 0d — Assign instance and output net names

```
eco_inst = eco_<jira>_<seq>    (e.g., eco_<jira>_001)
eco_out  = n_eco_<jira>_<seq>  (e.g., n_eco_<jira>_001)
```
Same seq used across all 3 stages for the same logical change.

### 0e — Record as new_logic_insertion entry in study JSON

```json
{
  "change_type": "new_logic_dff",
  "target_register": "<signal_name>",
  "instance_scope": "<INST_A>/<INST_B>",
  "cell_type": "<DFF_cell_type>",
  "instance_name": "eco_<jira>_<seq>",
  "output_net": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>",
  "port_connections": {"<clk_pin>": "<clock_net>", "<data_pin>": "<data_net>", "<reset_pin>": "<reset_net>", "<q_pin>": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>"},
  "input_from_change": <N_or_null>,
  "confirmed": true
}
```
For combinational gate: same structure with `"change_type": "new_logic_gate"`, add `"gate_function": "<NAND2|NOR2|...>"`, omit reset pin.

### 0f — Mark wire_swap entries that depend on new_logic outputs

For each `wire_swap` whose `new_token` matches a `new_logic` output net (`n_eco_<jira>_<seq>`), add `"new_logic_dependency": [<seq>]`.

**For wire_swap changes that require a new MUX select gate:**

Read `mux_select_gate_function` from the RTL diff JSON for this change:

```python
change = load_rtl_diff_change_for(wire_swap_target)
gate_fn = change.get("mux_select_gate_function")  # pre-computed by rtl_diff_analyzer Step D-MUX

if gate_fn is not None:
    # Gate function is pre-computed — create new_logic_gate entry directly
    create_new_logic_gate_entry(
        gate_function=gate_fn,
        i0_net=change["mux_select_i0_net"],
        i1_net=change["mux_select_i1_net"],
        reasoning=change["mux_select_reasoning"]
    )
    # Step 4c-POLARITY in Phase 1 is NOT needed — skip it for this entry
else:
    # Gate function not resolved by analyzer (MUX cell not found in Step 1)
    # Do NOT create entry in Phase 0 — let Phase 1 Step 4c-POLARITY determine it
    pass
```

**Do NOT derive the gate function from the RTL condition text.** The gate function is always read from `mux_select_gate_function` in the JSON (set by rtl_diff_analyzer Step D-MUX) or deferred to Phase 1 Step 4c-POLARITY if that field is null. Never compute the gate function independently in Phase 0.

The RTL condition text gives the wrong gate function whenever the true-branch maps to I0 (requires NOT(condition), not condition itself). Reading the RTL condition alone → always produces the condition gate (e.g., NAND2) → always wrong when true-branch is on I0.

**Any `new_logic_gate` entry for a wire_swap MUX select must be created in Phase 1 Step 4c-POLARITY with the gate_function derived from Steps 4a-4c. If such an entry was already created (e.g., from a previous phase or from the RTL diff hint), override its `gate_function` with the Step 4c-POLARITY result.**

### 0g — Process `new_port` changes → `port_declaration` study entries

**CRITICAL — Determine `declaration_type` before anything else:**

Read the RTL diff `context_line` for this change:
- If `context_line` contains `input` or `output` keyword → `declaration_type: "input"` or `"output"` — this is a **true port** of the module. The eco_applier will add it to the module port list AND add an `input`/`output` direction declaration in the module body.
- If `context_line` contains only `wire` keyword (e.g., `wire <signal_name>;`) → `declaration_type: "wire"` — this is a **local wire inside the module** connecting submodule instances. The eco_applier adds ONLY a `wire <signal_name>;` line to the module body. **No port list modification.** This avoids the long-port-list depth-tracking failure that occurs in P&R stages.

Why wire declarations must NOT modify the port list: the module's port list only contains signals that are ports (visible outside the module). A wire declared inside a module to connect two submodule instances is never a port — adding it to the port list produces invalid Verilog. The eco_applier's port list depth tracking also fails for very long P&R port lists, causing the wire to be silently skipped.

1. Identify `module_name`, `signal_name` (`new_token`), `declaration_type` (input/output/**wire**), `flat_net_name`, `instance_scope`.
2. Detect netlist type (do once, reuse): `grep -c "^module " /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v` — count > 1 = hierarchical; count = 1 = flat.
3. If hierarchical: verify module exists, set `confirmed: true`. If flat: use `port_promotion` (0i) instead.
4. Record:
```json
{"change_type": "port_declaration", "module_name": "<module>", "signal_name": "<signal>",
 "declaration_type": "input|output|wire", "flat_net_name": "<net>", "instance_scope": "<path>",
 "netlist_type": "hierarchical", "confirmed": true}
```
> **Known failure mode:** Treating hierarchical as flat → applier skips port_declaration/port_connection → signal unconnected → FM "globally unmatched".

### 0h — Process `port_connection` changes → `port_connection` study entries

1. Identify `parent_module`, `instance_name`, `port_name`, `net_name`, `submodule_type`.
2. Re-use netlist type from 0g. If hierarchical: `confirmed: true` always.
3. Verify instance block in PreEco Synthesize: `grep -n "<submodule_type> <instance_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v | head -3`
4. Record:
```json
{"change_type": "port_connection", "parent_module": "<module>", "submodule_pattern": "<pattern>",
 "instance_name": "<INST>", "port_name": "<port>", "net_name": "<net>",
 "netlist_type": "hierarchical", "confirmed": true}
```

### 0i — Process `port_promotion` changes → `port_promotion` study entries

Verify net exists: `grep -cw "<signal_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v`. Record:
```json
{"change_type": "port_promotion", "module_name": "<module>", "signal_name": "<signal>",
 "declaration_type": "output", "flat_net_confirmed": true, "confirmed": true}
```

## Process Per Stage (Synthesize, PrePlace, Route)

**Multi-instance handling:** When `instances` field is non-null, process each instance's FM results INDEPENDENTLY — each instance gets its own confirmed cells, backward cone trace, and `new_logic_gate` entry with different `flat_net_name_per_instance`.

**IMPORTANT — Fallback for missing FM results:** If no qualifying cells for a stage, apply the **Stage Fallback** (below). Every stage must be studied.

### 1. Read the PreEco netlist (once per stage)
```bash
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/<Stage>.v.gz > /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v
grep -n "<cell_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | head -20
```

### 2–3. Find and extract cell instantiation block

Read from the line with the cell name through the closing `);`. Extract all `.portname(netname)` entries.

### 4. Confirm old_net is present

**Step 1 — Try direct old_net name:**
```bash
grep -c "\.<pin>(<old_token>)" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v
```
If count ≥ 1 → `"old_net": "<old_token>"`, `"confirmed": true` — proceed to 4b.

**Step 2 — If not found, check for HFS alias on that pin:** Read the cell instantiation block, find actual net on `<pin>`. Verify alias via parent module port connection. If confirmed:
- `"old_net": "<P&R_alias>"`, `"confirmed": true`, `"old_net_alias": true`, `"old_net_alias_reason": "direct <old_token> not on pin — HFS alias confirmed as equivalent"`

**Do NOT silently drop a cell** because direct old_net is not on the pin — always check HFS alias first.

If neither direct name NOR alias found: `"confirmed": false`, reason: "old_net not found on pin — no direct name or HFS alias match".

### 4b. Verify new_net is reachable (Priority 1/2)

**CRITICAL — Always prefer the direct signal name over HFS aliases.** HFS aliases are buffer tree branches scoped to a region — using them over the direct name can cause FM stage-to-stage failures.

**`old_net` being an HFS alias does NOT bypass Priority 1.** `new_net` for Priority 1 is always `new_token` from the RTL diff — NEVER derived from the alias pattern of `old_net`.

**Priority 1 — Direct signal name (ALWAYS try first):**
```bash
grep -cw "<new_token>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v
```
If count ≥ 1 → `"new_net": "<new_token>"`, `"new_net_alias": null` — **STOP. Do NOT search for alias. Do NOT set new_net_alias.**

**Priority 2 — HFS alias (ONLY if direct absent):**
```bash
grep -n "<new_net_root>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | \
  grep -v "^\s*\(wire\|input\|output\|reg\)" | head -10
```
If alias found: `"new_net_alias": "<P&R_alias>"`, `"new_net_reachable": true`, add alias reason.
If no alias: `"new_net_reachable": false`, `"confirmed": false`, reason: "new_net not found and no HFS alias found".

### Cone Verification (MANDATORY for wire_swap)

#### Backward Cone (max 8 hops)

**Purpose:** Confirm the cell is in the backward cone of the TARGET REGISTER. FM confirms the cell uses `old_net` — it does NOT confirm backward cone membership. "FM confirmed" is NOT proof. Trace explicitly.

Read `target_register` and `target_bit` from `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_rtl_diff.json`. If `target_register` is null, skip.

**Step 1 — Find target register D-input net:**
```bash
grep -n "<target_register>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | head -10
```
The gate-level instance name for `target_register` bit `[N]` may appear as `<target_register>_reg_<N>_` (synthesis appends `_reg_<N>_`). If `target_bit` is null (scalar register), search for `<target_register>_reg` without a bit suffix. In the matching cell instance block, locate the `.D(<net>)` line — that net is `<target_d_net>`. If multiple instances match, use the one whose `.Q` or `.QN` output net name contains the register name (confirming it is the right flip-flop).

**Step 2 — Trace backward (max 8 hops):** Find driver of `<target_d_net>` (pin ZN/Z/Q/CO/S), read its input nets, repeat backward until `old_net` (or HFS alias) appears on an input pin (FOUND) or you reach a primary input/clock net (NOT FOUND).

**Step 3 — Decision:**
- In cone → `"in_backward_cone": true`
- Not in cone → `"confirmed": false`, `"in_backward_cone": false`, reason: "not in backward cone — output feeds different logic"

#### Forward Trace Verification (MANDATORY for cells marked in_backward_cone: false, max 6 hops)

**Purpose:** Catch cases where the backward trace missed a path through complex logic restructuring.

**Step 1 — Find cell's output net** (pin Z/ZN/Q) → `<cell_output_net>`.

**Step 2 — Trace forward (max 6 hops):**
```bash
grep -n "( <cell_output_net> )" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v | grep -v "\.ZN\|\.Z\b\|\.Q\b" | head -5
```
Repeat forward until `<target_d_net>` reached (UPGRADED) or terminates at unrelated logic (exclusion confirmed).

**Step 3 — Update JSON:**
- UPGRADED: `"in_backward_cone": true`, `"confirmed": true`, `"forward_trace_verified": true`, `"forward_trace_result": "UPGRADED — output reaches <target_register><target_bit> via <hop_chain>"`
- CONFIRMED EXCLUDED: `"in_backward_cone": false`, `"confirmed": false`, `"forward_trace_verified": true`, `"forward_trace_result": "CONFIRMED EXCLUDED — output feeds <actual_destination>"`

### 4c-POLARITY — MUX Select Pin Polarity Check (FALLBACK when `mux_select_gate_function` is null)

**Run this step ONLY when `mux_select_gate_function` in the RTL diff JSON is null** (rtl_diff_analyzer could not find the MUX cell in the PreEco netlist). If `mux_select_gate_function` is already set, use it directly — do NOT re-run this step.

**Purpose:** Prevent using the wrong gate polarity for a MUX select pin, which produces inverted logic and causes FM failure on the target register across all rounds.

**When to run:** After `in_backward_cone: true`, when cell type is a MUX and `change_type` is `wire_swap` with new_net requiring a new gate.

**Step 1 — Read MUX port block from PreEco Synthesize:** Record `I0_net` (selected when S=0), `I1_net` (selected when S=1), output net, current select net.

**Step 2 — Parse RTL expression** from `context_line`: `<register> <= (<condition>) ? <branch_true> : <branch_false>`

**Step 3 — Match RTL branches to MUX inputs:** Trace driver of I0_net and I1_net to determine which carries `branch_true`.

**Step 4 — Compute the gate function for the new select explicitly:**

Do NOT use a polarity label (inverting/non-inverting) — derive the gate function directly from the boolean expression.

**Step 4a — Express the RTL condition in terms of ECO input signals:**

From the RTL diff `context_line`, identify the condition expression: e.g., `~E | ~A` or `E & A` or similar. This is the condition whose truth selects the true-branch.

**Step 4b — Determine what S must equal:**

- If true-branch maps to **I1**: the MUX selects I1 when S=1 → **S must equal the condition** → the gate implements the condition directly
- If true-branch maps to **I0**: the MUX selects I0 when S=0 → **S must equal NOT(condition)** → the gate implements the logical complement of the condition

**Step 4c — Map the boolean expression for S to a standard gate:**

| Boolean expression for S | Standard gate |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| `E & A` | AND2 |
| `~(E & A)` = `~E \| ~A` | NAND2 |
| `E \| A` | OR2 |
| `~(E \| A)` = `~E & ~A` | NOR2 |
| `~E` | INV |
| `E` | buffer (or direct wire) |
| More inputs | AND3, NAND3, OR3, NOR3, etc. |

**Example A (true-branch on I0, condition = `~E \| ~A`):**
- S = NOT(condition) = NOT(`~E \| ~A`) = `E & A` → **AND2**

**Example B (true-branch on I1, condition = `~E \| ~A`):**
- S = condition = `~E \| ~A` → **NAND2**

**Example C (true-branch on I0, condition = `E & A`):**
- S = NOT(condition) = NOT(`E & A`) = `~E \| ~A` → **NAND2**

The same condition expression produces different gates depending on which MUX input carries the true-branch.

> **Critical:** Never read the gate function from the RTL condition text alone without completing Steps 4a-4c. The condition expression and the gate function for S are NOT the same — they are only equal when the true-branch maps to I1. When the true-branch maps to I0, the gate must implement NOT(condition), which is a different gate. Always complete Step 3 (I0/I1 mapping) before Step 4.

**Step 5 — Create or override the `new_logic_gate` entry with the correct gate function:**

This is the authoritative step for determining the MUX select gate. Any gate function set earlier (from Phase 0 or from the RTL diff hint) MUST be overridden here:

```python
# Find or create the new_logic_gate entry for the MUX select cell
mux_gate_entry = find_entry(study_json, instance_name="eco_<jira>_mux_sel")
if mux_gate_entry:
    # Override — Phase 0 may have created this with wrong gate_function from RTL hint
    mux_gate_entry["gate_function"] = gate_function_for_new_select  # from Step 4c above
    mux_gate_entry["mux_select_polarity"] = {
        "i0_net": "<net_on_I0_pin>",
        "i1_net": "<net_on_I1_pin>",
        "branch_true_maps_to": "I0|I1",
        "s_expression": "condition|NOT(condition)",
        "gate_function_for_new_select": "<AND2|NAND2|OR2|NOR2|...>",
        "reasoning": "<derivation: true-branch on I0|I1 → S=condition|NOT(condition) → gate type>"
    }
else:
    # Create new entry
    create_new_logic_gate_entry(gate_function=gate_function_for_new_select, ...)
```

**Verify the gate_function in the study JSON matches Step 4c output before proceeding to Step 5 (output count check).** If there is a discrepancy (gate_function still shows the RTL hint value), correct it now.

> **This rule prevents:** Using an inverting gate when a non-inverting gate is required (or vice versa) — the MUX selects the wrong input every cycle and FM fails across all rounds.

### 4d. Structural Analysis — Timing & LOL Estimation (Synthesize only)

For each confirmed cell, compare driver structure of `old_net` vs `new_net` in PreEco Synthesize. Find driver of each net (cell on output pin Z/ZN/Q). Compare fanout: `grep -c "( <net> )" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_Synthesize.v`. Record:
```json
"timing_lol_analysis": {
  "old_net_driver": "<cell> (<type>) pin=<Z/ZN/Q>",
  "new_net_driver": "<cell> (<type>) pin=<Z/ZN/Q>",
  "old_net_fanout": <N>, "new_net_fanout": <N>,
  "timing_estimate": "<BETTER|LIKELY_BETTER|NEUTRAL|RISK|LOAD_RISK|UNCERTAIN>",
  "reasoning": "<1-sentence explanation>"
}
```
Use: FF.Q driver → BETTER; shallower comb → LIKELY_BETTER; same depth → NEUTRAL; deeper cone → RISK; higher fanout → LOAD_RISK; unclear → UNCERTAIN.

### 5. Verify output count before moving to next stage

```
Qualifying list had: N cells
Output JSON has:     N entries  ← must match
```

### 6. Clean up temp file (after processing all cells for that stage)
```bash
rm -f /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v
```

## Stage Fallback — For Any Stage with No FM Result

When find_equivalent_nets returns no qualifying cells for any stage, use confirmed cells from another stage and grep those cell names directly in the missing stage's PreEco netlist. P&R tools preserve instance names across all stages — same cell name exists in Synthesize, PrePlace, and Route.

**Step F1 — Find best reference stage** (priority: Synthesize → PrePlace → Route). Take all `"confirmed": true` entries from that stage.

**Step F2 — Grep each cell in missing stage:**
```bash
zcat <REF_DIR>/data/PreEco/<MissingStage>.v.gz > /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<MissingStage>.v
grep -n "<cell_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<MissingStage>.v | head -20
```

**Step F3 — Verify old_net on expected pin:**
```bash
grep -c "\.<pin>(<old_net>)" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<MissingStage>.v
```
- count = 1 → `"confirmed": true`, `"source": "<ref>_fallback"`
- count = 0 → `"confirmed": false`, reason recorded, do NOT abort
- count > 1 → `"confirmed": false`, `"reason": "AMBIGUOUS — multiple occurrences"`

**Step F4 — Handle net name differences:** If `grep -c "\.<pin>(<old_net>)" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<MissingStage>.v` returns 0, search for the signal root (the signal name without any `_0_` bus suffix or `_reg` synthesis suffix):
```bash
grep -n "<signal_root>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<MissingStage>.v | grep "<cell_name>" | head -5
```
Read the actual net name on the expected pin from the cell instance block. If a different net name is found on that pin: record it as `old_net` for this stage and mark `"net_name_differs": true`. This accounts for P&R renaming of nets between stages while preserving cell instance names.

**Step F5 — Cleanup:** `rm -f /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<MissingStage>.v`

**Step F6 — Repeat F1–F5 for every missing stage independently.** Never leave any stage array empty if any other stage has confirmed cells.

Fallback JSON flag:
```json
{"cell_name": "<cell>", "pin": "<pin>", "old_net": "<net>", "new_net": "<net>",
 "confirmed": true, "source": "<ref_stage>_fallback", "fm_result_available": false}
```

---

## Output JSON

Write `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json`. Each stage is an array — one entry per qualifying cell.

**`change_type` translation:** `wire_swap` → `rewire`; `new_logic` → `new_logic_dff` or `new_logic_gate` based on cell type. RTL diff values are NOT used in the study JSON.

**MANDATORY: Sort each stage array by processing order before writing:**
```python
PASS_ORDER = {
    "new_logic": 1, "new_logic_dff": 1, "new_logic_gate": 1,  # Pass 1
    "port_declaration": 2, "port_promotion": 2,                 # Pass 2
    "port_connection": 3,                                        # Pass 3
    "rewire": 4,                                                 # Pass 4
}
for stage in ["Synthesize", "PrePlace", "Route"]:
    study[stage].sort(key=lambda e: PASS_ORDER.get(e.get("change_type", "rewire"), 4))
```
eco_applier processes arrays in order — unsorted entries cause rewires to run before new_logic insertions exist.

### Example — new_logic_dff with port_connections_per_stage:
```json
{
  "change_type": "new_logic_dff",
  "target_register": "<signal_name>",
  "instance_scope": "<INST_A>/<INST_B>",
  "cell_type": "<DFF_cell_type>",
  "instance_name": "eco_<jira>_<seq>",
  "output_net": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>",
  "port_connections": {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_synthesize>", "<data_pin>": "<data_net_synthesize>", "<q_pin>": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>", "<aux_pin1>": "<aux_net_synthesize>"},
  "port_connections_per_stage": {
    "Synthesize": {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_synthesize>", "<data_pin>": "<data_net_synthesize>", "<q_pin>": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>", "<aux_pin1>": "<aux_net_synthesize>"},
    "PrePlace":   {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_preplace>",   "<data_pin>": "<data_net_preplace>",   "<q_pin>": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>", "<aux_pin1>": "<neighbour_aux_preplace>"},
    "Route":      {"<clk_pin>": "<clk_net_route>",      "<data_pin>": "<data_net_route>",      "<q_pin>": "n_eco_<jira>_<seq>", "<aux_pin1>": "<neighbour_aux_route>"}
  },
  "input_from_change": null,
  "confirmed": true
}
```

### Example — rewire with backward cone fields:
```json
{
  "cell_name": "<cell_name>",
  "cell_type": "<cell_type>",
  "pin": "<pin>",
  "old_net": "<old_signal>",
  "new_net": "<new_signal>",
  "full_port_connections": {"<port_A>": "<net_A>", "<port_B>": "<old_signal>", "<port_Z>": "<output_net>"},
  "line_context": "<cell_type> <cell_name> (\n  .<port_A>(<net_A>),\n  .<port_B>(<old_signal>),\n  .<port_Z>(<output_net>)\n);",
  "confirmed": true,
  "in_backward_cone": true,
  "forward_trace_verified": true,
  "forward_trace_result": "CONFIRMED EXCLUDED — output feeds <actual_destination>",
  "new_net_reachable": true,
  "new_net_alias": null,
  "source": "synthesize_fallback",
  "fm_result_available": false
}
```

**Confirmed-false notes (merge into relevant entries):**
- Cell not found in PreEco: `"confirmed": false, "reason": "cell not found in PreEco netlist"`
- Old net not on expected pin: `"confirmed": false, "reason": "pin <pin> has net <actual_net> not expected <old_net>"`
- Multiple instances with same name: `"confirmed": false, "reason": "AMBIGUOUS — multiple occurrences"`
- Handle synthesis name mangling: cell name from FM may have `_reg` suffix appended by the synthesizer. If `grep -n "<cell_name>" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v` returns zero results, retry with `grep -n "<cell_name>_reg" /tmp/eco_study_<TAG>_<Stage>.v`. If the `_reg` variant is found, use it as the actual cell name in the study JSON. If neither is found: `"confirmed": false, "reason": "cell not found in PreEco netlist (tried both <cell_name> and <cell_name>_reg)"`
- If ALL stages have no FM results: mark all `"confirmed": false`, report for manual review

Your final output is `<BASE_DIR>/data/<TAG>_eco_preeco_study.json`. After writing, verify it is non-empty with at least one confirmed entry, then exit. **RPT is generated by ORCHESTRATOR, not this agent.**
